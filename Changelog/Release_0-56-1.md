  - Longjack files should be rated JackSpeed instead of Technical.
  - Files with hard Jack sections have more JackSpeed so it makes more sense. 
  - Stamina is less overrated.
  - Technical files are more properly rated, and include less longjack files.
  - Chordjacks & JackSpeed are basically the same thing.
  - Underrated files are even more underrated.
