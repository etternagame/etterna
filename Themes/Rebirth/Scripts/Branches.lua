    -- HACK: ALSO USING THIS FOR ScreenTestInput DONT PANIC

    -- when exiting ScreenGameplaySyncMachine we need to go back where we came from
    -- ideally, entry is only from 2 points, ScreenSelectMusic or ScreenInputOptions[Sub]
    -- so if it is provided, use the ScreenSelectMusic exit direction instead
    -- another note: know that for some brilliant reason gameplay calls this twice in a row so resetting isnt exactly the brightest idea
    --  big brain: reset it after running more than once only ... i guess
    --  im not going to put any thought into why this could be really really bad
