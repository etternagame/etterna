--- Selection Wheel base class
--
-- This is the base class for other wheel classes such as @{MusicWheel} and @{RoomWheel}.
-- The easiest way to acquire the existing Wheel on a screen is `SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():GetMusicWheel()`.
--
-- This class inherits all methods from these classes:
-- @{ActorFrame}
-- @{Actor}
-- @classmod WheelBase

--- Move the wheel a given amount of choices in some direction.
-- @tparam int amount Amount to move. Nil does no move. Negative goes in the other direction.
-- @return self
function WheelBase:Move(amount)
end

--- Retrieve the @{WheelItemBase} at a given index.
-- This does not retrieve an arbitrarily far wheel item, but actually the visible item.
-- Every time a movement is made on the Wheel, the data behind each WheelItem is switched to another WheelItem.
-- For example, the highest allowed index to pass is `(NUM_WHEEL_ITEMS-1)` which comes from the metrics.ini definition for the Wheel implementation you are using (NumWheelItems).
-- @tparam int index Index for the WheelItem to retrieve.
-- @treturn WheelItemBase The WheelItem at the given index. Returns nil and throws an error if the index is not valid.
function WheelBase:GetWheelItem(index)
end

--- Query whether or not the Wheel is settled. The Wheel is settled if it is not moving or locked.
-- @treturn bool True if the wheel is not moving.
function WheelBase:IsSettled()
end

--- Query whether or not the Wheel is locked. The Wheel is locked when a selection was just made or roulette just finished.
-- @treturn bool True if the wheel is locked.
function WheelBase:IsLocked()
end

--- Set the current open section on the Wheel.
-- This is usually used to change the opened folder remotely.
-- @tparam string sectionName The name of a group or section, depending on the @{SortOrder}
-- @return self
function WheelBase:SetOpenSection(sectionName)
end

--- Get the current index of the hovered item in all of the data loaded in the Wheel. This is not restricted by NumWheelItems.
-- @treturn int Index of the currently hovered item.
function WheelBase:GetCurrentIndex()
end

--- Get the number of items in the data loaded in the Wheel. This is not restricted by NumWheelItems.
-- This may include all Songs and all Group items.
-- @treturn int Count of items in the Wheel.
function WheelBase:GetNumItems()
end

--- Get the @{WheelItemDataType} of the currently hovered WheelItem.
-- @treturn WheelItemDataType The type of the currently hovered WheelItem.
function WheelBase:GetSelectedType()
end

--- Rebuild the WheelItems to refresh the visual data.
-- @return self
function WheelBase:RebuildWheelItems()
end
