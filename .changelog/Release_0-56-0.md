## [0.56.0] - 2017-10-17 - Pre-release: Calculator Updates

Windows, and Mac pre-release. The MSD Calculator is receiving heavy chiseling.

### Changed
- The Calculator has been updated - [98f806b](../../../commit/98f806ba514fd24d4dc58a6868de3b7a5fb567e0)
  - Chordjack files should be rated more JackSpeed instead of Handstream
  - Stream files should be less populated with fast Jumpstream & more populated with actual Stream.
  - Actual Stream got a buff, while files that aren't Stream but got rated Stream should be nerfed.
  - Handstream files should actually show up as Handstream.
  - Stamina files should not be made up of sets of overrated files and underrated files. Perfectly distributed.
  - "Real" Technical files may be buffed.
  - Scores under a certain percentage, scaled by initial MSD, will not receive SSRs. 10s are around 50%. 30s are around 70%.
