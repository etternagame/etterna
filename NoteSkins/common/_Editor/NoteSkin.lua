USW Noteskin.lua Version V2
Made for Version Stepmania 5 Preview 4

I am the bone of my noteskin
Arrows are my body, and explosions are my blood
I have created over a thousand noteskins
Unknown to death
Nor known to life
Have withstood pain to create many noteskins
Yet these hands will never hold anything
So as I pray, Unlimited Stepman Works

If you want to know the list of lua commands you can use here is the main page for help http://kki.ajworld.net/lua/sm5/Lua.xml

local ret = ... or {};

--I always had the problem were I wrote var instead of Var, which really iritated me wondering why a code wouldnt work
--You can edit it out if you want, But I'm just gonna leave it here so incase a person wants to make a noteskin
--And gets the same problem as me were you use var instead of Var, atleast this should make it still work
--But its best to use Var, And make sure to check all your code for little mistakes while you write ;)
local var = Var;

This is the general redirect table, Not the general redirect code, We use this if we are lazy ;)
Or if we cant a directon of a noteskin use the exact same files as another direction
The most re used direction in this case is "Down"
You can add and remove values if you want, It works for every game type,
If you want an easy way to know how all directions are called go in to stepmaniaoptions and change gametype
Then if you go to key configure look at the names for the keys, They are the same names that are used in the noteskin.lua

	DownRight = "Down",

This is the general redirect code, We use this if we want to redirect parts of noteskins to other parts
Because unlike the ret.RedirTable which redirects everything to the defined direction.
Here we can add redirects for seperate elements which means we can use separate images if we want

This is the general function code
In here we can define how we want the stuff to act
Which basicly means instead of using a load of lua files for just some effect
We can just use code in here so we need to use less files
Which is nice if you want to save up space ;)
Only problem is that the Hold/Roll parts are written down in the code as sprite files
Which is the original old 3.9 code, Which basicly means that their code doesnt work in here

Also unlike the general redirect code which has sElement and sButton defined in the common noteskin
They need to be defined here manualy which can be done with 
local sElement = Var "Element";
local sButton = Var "Button";
To make it easier for everyone I already added them
The reason we use local to define the stuff is for when a code doesnt accept the full code
Like for example if we did string.find(Var "Element", "Down") it wouldnt work

	--Because the rotate table is set up for dance and these are for PIU
