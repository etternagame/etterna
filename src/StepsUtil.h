	// and cache it turned into a mess that still didn't work.

	// which is transformed into a StepsID, which is then used to index into a
	// map.  So when the theme goes to look up the scores for a Steps, the
	// Steps has a hash value of 0, unless it has been played.  But when the
	// scores are saved, the Steps has a correct hash value.  So before a
	// Steps is played, the scores could not be correctly accessed.  This was
	// only visible on Edit charts because scores on all other difficulties
	// are saved without a hash value.
	// Making operator< and operator== treat 0 as equal to all other hash
	// values allows the theme to fetch the scores even though the Steps has
	// a cleared hash value, but is not a good long term solution because the
	// description field isn't always going to be unique.
