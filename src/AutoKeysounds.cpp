/*
 * This class handles two things: auto-play preload, and runtime auto-play sounds.
 *
 * On song start, all autoplay sounds and the main BGM track (if any) are combined
 * into a single chain, which is used as the song background.  Sounds added this way
 * are removed from the NoteData.
 *
 * Any sounds not added to the sound chain and any autoplay sounds added to the NoteData
 * during play (usually due to battle mode mods) are played dynamically, via Update().
 *
 * Note that autoplay sounds which are played before the BGM starts will never be
 * placed in the sound chain, since the sound chain becomes the BGM; the BGM can't
 * play sound before it starts.  These sounds will be left in the NoteData, and played
 * as dynamic sounds; this means that they don't get robust sync.  This isn't a problem
 * for imported BMS files, which don't have an offset value, but it's annoying.
