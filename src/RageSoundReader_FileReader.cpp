	 * "Not Vorbis data"; ignore it so we always give a consistent error message, and
	 * continue trying other file formats.
	 *
	 * OPEN_FATAL_ERROR: Either the file was opened successfully and appears to be the
	 * correct format, but a fatal format-specific error was encountered that will probably
	 * not be fixed by using a different reader (for example, an Ogg file that doesn't
	 * actually contain any audio streams); or the file failed to open or read ("I/O
	 * error", "permission denied"), in which case all other readers will probably fail,
	 * too.  The returned error is used, and no other formats will be tried.
