/*
 * When streaming files in gameplay, we need to be able to access files without blocking.
 * If we read data and it's not currently in the OS's read-ahead cache, we'll block while
 * it reads, which will usually take 10-20ms and cause a frame skip.
 *
 * One common case of this is playing a background movie.  We'll open the file when the
 * screen loads, but it may not be played for over a minute, during which time we'll be
 * streaming from other movies.  When we come back, the file may not have any read-ahead
 * waiting for us.
 *
 * Linux provides two calls that can help here:
 *
 * posix_readahead; this hints the OS that we're streaming a file, so it doesn't need to
 * preserve cache behind where we've read.  This reduces the chance of pushing other files
 * out of cache.  However, this can also cause new skips; if we need to rewind a movie and
 * start it over, the beginning will be out of the cache.
 *
 * readahead: this explicitly triggers a specific file read-ahead.  This blocks, so if we
 * use this we need to do it in a thread.
 *
 * We work like this:
 *
 * - Persistantly cache the first N bytes of the file.
 * - Open a worker thread for read-ahead, which is idle most of the time.
 * - When we read from the first 128k of the file, take it directly out of our cache, and
 *   seek the file past our cache.
 * - When any data is read from the cached part of the file and readahead hasn't been performed,
 *   trigger readahead() to be done in the worker thread, so data past our cache is ready when
 *   we get there.
 * - When any data is read outside of the cached part of the file, reset our state so we know
 *   to do the readahead again the next time we're back at the start of the file.
 *
 * This means that reading should always be nonblocking, given these constraints:
 * - We must consistently stream a file starting at the beginning, and don't seek to random points
 *   in the file.
 * - We read the file slowly enough that we don't overtake the read-ahead cache, which for most
 *   streaming files shouldn't be a problem.
