/* This is a simple class to handle special input devices. Update() will be
 * called during the input update; the derived class should send appropriate
 * events to InputHandler. 
 * Note that, if the underlying device is capable of it, you're free to start
 * a blocking thread; just store inputs in your class and send them off in a
 * batch on the next Update. This gets much more accurate timestamps; we get
 * events more quickly and timestamp them, instead of having a rough timing
 * granularity due to the framerate.
 * Send input events for a specific type of device. Only one driver for a given
 * set of InputDevice types should be loaded for a given arch. For example,
 * any number of drivers may produce DEVICE_PUMPn events, but only one may be
 * loaded at a time. (This will be inconvenient if, for example, we have two
 * completely distinct methods of getting input for the same device; we have no
 * method to allocate device numbers. We don't need this now; I'll write it
 * if it becomes needed.) */
