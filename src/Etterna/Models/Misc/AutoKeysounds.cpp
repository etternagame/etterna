/*
 * This class handles two things: auto-play preload, and runtime auto-play
 * sounds.
 *
 * On song start, all autoplay sounds and the main BGM track (if any) are
 * combined into a single chain, which is used as the song background.  Sounds
 * added this way are removed from the NoteData.
 *
 * Any sounds not added to the sound chain and any autoplay sounds added to the
 * NoteData during play (usually due to battle mode mods) are played
 * dynamically, via Update().
 *
 * Note that autoplay sounds which are played before the BGM starts will never
 * be placed in the sound chain, since the sound chain becomes the BGM; the BGM
 * can't play sound before it starts.  These sounds will be left in the
 * NoteData, and played as dynamic sounds; this means that they don't get robust
 * sync.  This isn't a problem for imported BMS files, which don't have an
 * offset value, but it's annoying.
