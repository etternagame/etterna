/* meta info is information that is derived from two or more consecutive
 * noteinfos, the first level of pattern abstraction is generated from noteinfo,
 * the second level of abstraction is generated from the meta info produced by
 * the first level of abstraction, and so on and so forth. meta info is
 * constructed on the fly per row and each row's meta info is able to look back
 * 3-4 rows into the past for relevant pattern information, in that sense meta
 * info contains information that persists beyond the explicit bounds of its
 * generation point, and that information may carry forward into the next
 * generation point, functionally speaking this has the effect of carrying
 * pattern sequence detection through intervals, reducing the error caused by
 * interval splicing*/
