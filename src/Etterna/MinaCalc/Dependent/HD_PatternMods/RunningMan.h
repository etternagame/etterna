/** Hand-Dependent PatternMod detecting a RunningMen.
 * Unlike other pattern mods runningman sequencing has 2 core purposes, the
 * primary one involves tracking the anchor speed of a runningman sequence and
 * using that plus other characteristics of the runningman to guess at a more ms
 * oriented baseline difficulty, which gets rolled into the tech base
 * calculations, this happens during the main row loop in ulbu, but not inside
 * the pattern mod loop. The other is the usual pattern mod generation, which
 * generates a pattern mod out purely the characteristics, independent of the
 * anchor speed. This is to slightly push up small runningman anchors inside
 * streams, or js, etc, and to fully push up much heavier runningman oriented
 * patterns in those same skillsets (policy in the sky, etc) */
