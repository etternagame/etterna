/* this is a row by row sequencer that constructs basic and advanced hand based
 * patterns given noteinfo input for a current row, and its own output of the
 * last row */

// perhaps this should contain no timing information, only pattern information?

/// potentially outdated comment below
/// this should contain most everything needed for the generic pattern mods,
/// extremely specific sequencing will take place in separate areas like with
/// rm_seuqencing, and widerange scalers should track their own interval queues
/// metanoteinfo is generated per row, from current noteinfo and the previous
/// metanoteinfo object, each metanoteinfo stores some basic information from
/// the last object, allowing us to look back 3-4 rows into the past without
/// having to explicitly store more than 2 mni objects, and we can recycle the
/// pointers as we generate the info metanoteinfo is generated per _hand_, not
/// per note or column. it contains the relevant information for determining
/// what the column configuation of each hand is for any row, and it contains
/// timestamp arrays for each column, so it is unnecessary to generate
/// information per note, even though in some ways it might be more convenient
/// or clearer
