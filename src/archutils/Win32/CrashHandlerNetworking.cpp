/* This has an arch-like abstraction layout, since it's intended to become one.
 * It'll be moved out of here as things get polished further. The Winsock and
 * BSD implementations will be kept separate, since while they look similar,
 * they're different in the details, especially when you want to cleanly support
 * cancellation.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Allow cancellation at any time. The only thing more annoying than a laggy
 *  network, is an application that won't immediately respond to cancelling.
 *  (This is even more important here, since we're using this after a crash.)
 * - Assume some operations and/or some architectures are going to have problems
 *  doing everything nonblockingly, and do everything in a thread. This also
 * allows more complex network interactions, since it doesn't need to maintain
 * an equally complex state machine.
 * - When an operation is cancelled or an error occurs, all operations until the
 *  next call to Close() become no-ops. This allows lenient error checking; it's
 *  guaranteed that further calls to Read or Write will not reset the error
 * state.
 * - The only function that may be called from another thread without
 * serialization is Cancel().
 *
 * All calls are blocking, except for:
 *
 * - Cancel(), which is always nonblocking. The operation in progress, if any,
 *  will be aborted immediately. (The only exception here is incomplete
 *  implementations, which may block);
 * - Close(), if Shutdown() was called first, since the necessary blocking
 * occurs during Shutdown;
 * - Close(), if an error or cancellation occurred.
 *
 * Accepting incoming TCP connections is beyond the immediate scope of this
 * interface (that would involve a second listener class, which would be a
 * factory for NetworkStream). UDP is probably within the scope of this class,
 * but there are some outstanding design issues and it's beyond the work I'm
 * doing right now. */
