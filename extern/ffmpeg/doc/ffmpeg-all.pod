ffmpeg - ffmpeg video converter

=head1 SYNOPSIS


ffmpeg [I<global_options>] {[I<input_file_options>] -i F<input_url>} ... {[I<output_file_options>] F<output_url>} ...


=head1 DESCRIPTION


B<ffmpeg> is a very fast video and audio converter that can also grab from
a live audio/video source. It can also convert between arbitrary sample
rates and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase filter.

B<ffmpeg> reads from an arbitrary number of input "files" (which can be regular
files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.), specified by the
C<-i> option, and writes to an arbitrary number of output "files", which are
specified by a plain output url. Anything found on the command line which
cannot be interpreted as an option is considered to be an output url.

Each input or output url can, in principle, contain any number of streams of
different types (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data). The allowed number and/or
types of streams may be limited by the container format. Selecting which
streams from which inputs will go into which output is either done automatically
or with the C<-map> option (see the Stream selection chapter).

To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices (0-based). E.g.
the first input file is C<0>, the second is C<1>, etc. Similarly, streams
within a file are referred to by their indices. E.g. C<2:3> refers to the
fourth stream in the third input file. Also see the Stream specifiers chapter.

As a general rule, options are applied to the next specified
file. Therefore, order is important, and you can have the same
option on the command line multiple times. Each occurrence is
then applied to the next input or output file.
Exceptions from this rule are the global options (e.g. verbosity level),
which should be specified first.

Do not mix input and output files -- first specify all input files, then all
output files. Also do not mix options which belong to different files. All
options apply ONLY to the next input or output file and are reset between files.

The format option may be needed for raw input files.



=head1 DETAILED DESCRIPTION


The transcoding process in B<ffmpeg> for each output can be described by
the following diagram:

	
	 _______              ______________
	|       |            |              |
	| input |  demuxer   | encoded data |   decoder
	| file  | ---------> | packets      | -----+
	|_______|            |______________|      |

	                                       _________
	                                      |         |
	                                      | decoded |
	                                      | frames  |
	                                      |_________|
	 ________             ______________       |
	|        |           |              |      |
	| output | <-------- | encoded data | <----+
	| file   |   muxer   | packets      |   encoder
	|________|           |______________|
	
	


B<ffmpeg> calls the libavformat library (containing demuxers) to read
input files and get packets containing encoded data from them. When there are
multiple input files, B<ffmpeg> tries to keep them synchronized by
tracking lowest timestamp on any active input stream.

Encoded packets are then passed to the decoder (unless streamcopy is selected
for the stream, see further for a description). The decoder produces
uncompressed frames (raw video/PCM audio/...) which can be processed further by
filtering (see next section). After filtering, the frames are passed to the
encoder, which encodes them and outputs encoded packets. Finally those are
passed to the muxer, which writes the encoded packets to the output file.


=head2 Filtering

Before encoding, B<ffmpeg> can process raw audio and video frames using
filters from the libavfilter library. Several chained filters form a filter
graph. B<ffmpeg> distinguishes between two types of filtergraphs:
simple and complex.


=head3 Simple filtergraphs

Simple filtergraphs are those that have exactly one input and output, both of
the same type. In the above diagram they can be represented by simply inserting
an additional step between decoding and encoding:

	
	 _________                        ______________
	|         |                      |              |
	| decoded |                      | encoded data |
	| frames  |\                   _ | packets      |
	|_________| \                  /||______________|
	             \   __________   /
	  simple     _\||          | /  encoder
	  filtergraph   | filtered |/
	                | frames   |
	                |__________|
	


Simple filtergraphs are configured with the per-stream B<-filter> option
(with B<-vf> and B<-af> aliases for video and audio respectively).
A simple filtergraph for video can look for example like this:

	
	 _______        _____________        _______        ________
	|       |      |             |      |       |      |        |
	| input | ---> | deinterlace | ---> | scale | ---> | output |
	|_______|      |_____________|      |_______|      |________|
	


Note that some filters change frame properties but not frame contents. E.g. the
C<fps> filter in the example above changes number of frames, but does not
touch the frame contents. Another example is the C<setpts> filter, which
only sets timestamps and otherwise passes the frames unchanged.


=head3 Complex filtergraphs

Complex filtergraphs are those which cannot be described as simply a linear
processing chain applied to one stream. This is the case, for example, when the graph has
more than one input and/or output, or when output stream type is different from
input. They can be represented with the following diagram:

	
	 _________
	|         |
	| input 0 |\                    __________
	|_________| \                  |          |
	             \   _________    /| output 0 |
	              \ |         |  / |__________|
	 _________     \| complex | /
	|         |     |         |/
	| input 1 |---->| filter  |\
	|_________|     |         | \   __________
	               /| graph   |  \ |          |
	              / |         |   \| output 1 |
	 _________   /  |_________|    |__________|
	|         | /
	| input 2 |/
	|_________|
	


Complex filtergraphs are configured with the B<-filter_complex> option.
Note that this option is global, since a complex filtergraph, by its nature,
cannot be unambiguously associated with a single stream or file.

The B<-lavfi> option is equivalent to B<-filter_complex>.

A trivial example of a complex filtergraph is the C<overlay> filter, which
has two video inputs and one video output, containing one video overlaid on top
of the other. Its audio counterpart is the C<amix> filter.


=head2 Stream copy

Stream copy is a mode selected by supplying the C<copy> parameter to the
B<-codec> option. It makes B<ffmpeg> omit the decoding and encoding
step for the specified stream, so it does only demuxing and muxing. It is useful
for changing the container format or modifying container-level metadata. The
diagram above will, in this case, simplify to this:

	
	 _______              ______________            ________
	|       |            |              |          |        |
	| input |  demuxer   | encoded data |  muxer   | output |
	| file  | ---------> | packets      | -------> | file   |
	|_______|            |______________|          |________|
	


Since there is no decoding or encoding, it is very fast and there is no quality
loss. However, it might not work in some cases because of many factors. Applying
filters is obviously also impossible, since filters work on uncompressed data.



=head1 STREAM SELECTION


B<ffmpeg> provides the C<-map> option for manual control of stream selection in each
output file. Users can skip C<-map> and let ffmpeg perform automatic stream selection as
described below. The C<-vn / -an / -sn / -dn> options can be used to skip inclusion of
video, audio, subtitle and data streams respectively, whether manually mapped or automatically
selected, except for those streams which are outputs of complex filtergraphs.


=head2 Description

The sub-sections that follow describe the various rules that are involved in stream selection.
The examples that follow next show how these rules are applied in practice.

While every effort is made to accurately reflect the behavior of the program, FFmpeg is under
continuous development and the code may have changed since the time of this writing.


=head3 Automatic stream selection


In the absence of any map options for a particular output file, ffmpeg inspects the output
format to check which type of streams can be included in it, viz. video, audio and/or
subtitles. For each acceptable stream type, ffmpeg will pick one stream, when available,
from among all the inputs.

It will select that stream based upon the following criteria:

=over 4


=item *

for video, it is the stream with the highest resolution,

=item *

for audio, it is the stream with the most channels,

=item *

for subtitles, it is the first subtitle stream found but there's a caveat.
The output format's default subtitle encoder can be either text-based or image-based,
and only a subtitle stream of the same type will be chosen.

=back


In the case where several streams of the same type rate equally, the stream with the lowest
index is chosen.

Data or attachment streams are not automatically selected and can only be included
using C<-map>.

=head3 Manual stream selection


When C<-map> is used, only user-mapped streams are included in that output file,
with one possible exception for filtergraph outputs described below.


=head3 Complex filtergraphs


If there are any complex filtergraph output streams with unlabeled pads, they will be added
to the first output file. This will lead to a fatal error if the stream type is not supported
by the output format. In the absence of the map option, the inclusion of these streams leads
to the automatic stream selection of their types being skipped. If map options are present,
these filtergraph streams are included in addition to the mapped streams.

Complex filtergraph output streams with labeled pads must be mapped once and exactly once.


=head3 Stream handling


Stream handling is independent of stream selection, with an exception for subtitles described
below. Stream handling is set via the C<-codec> option addressed to streams within a
specific I<output> file. In particular, codec options are applied by ffmpeg after the
stream selection process and thus do not influence the latter. If no C<-codec> option is
specified for a stream type, ffmpeg will select the default encoder registered by the output
file muxer.

An exception exists for subtitles. If a subtitle encoder is specified for an output file, the
first subtitle stream found of any type, text or image, will be included. ffmpeg does not validate
if the specified encoder can convert the selected stream or if the converted stream is acceptable
within the output format. This applies generally as well: when the user sets an encoder manually,
the stream selection process cannot check if the encoded stream can be muxed into the output file.
If it cannot, ffmpeg will abort and I<all> output files will fail to be processed.


=head2 Examples


The following examples illustrate the behavior, quirks and limitations of ffmpeg's stream
selection methods.

They assume the following three input files.

	
	
	input file 'A.avi'
	      stream 0: video 640x360
	      stream 1: audio 2 channels
	
	input file 'B.mp4'
	      stream 0: video 1920x1080
	      stream 1: audio 2 channels
	      stream 2: subtitles (text)
	      stream 3: audio 5.1 channels
	      stream 4: subtitles (text)
	
	input file 'C.mkv'
	      stream 0: video 1280x720
	      stream 1: audio 2 channels
	      stream 2: subtitles (image)



=head4 Example: automatic stream selection

	
	ffmpeg -i A.avi -i B.mp4 out1.mkv out2.wav -map 1:a -c:a copy out3.mov

There are three output files specified, and for the first two, no C<-map> options
are set, so ffmpeg will select streams for these two files automatically.

F<out1.mkv> is a Matroska container file and accepts video, audio and subtitle streams,
so ffmpeg will try to select one of each type.For video, it will select C<stream 0> from F<B.mp4>, which has the highest
resolution among all the input video streams.For audio, it will select C<stream 3> from F<B.mp4>, since it has the greatest
number of channels.For subtitles, it will select C<stream 2> from F<B.mp4>, which is the first subtitle
stream from among F<A.avi> and F<B.mp4>.

F<out2.wav> accepts only audio streams, so only C<stream 3> from F<B.mp4> is
selected.

For F<out3.mov>, since a C<-map> option is set, no automatic stream selection will
occur. The C<-map 1:a> option will select all audio streams from the second input
F<B.mp4>. No other streams will be included in this output file.

For the first two outputs, all included streams will be transcoded. The encoders chosen will
be the default ones registered by each output format, which may not match the codec of the
selected input streams.

For the third output, codec option for audio streams has been set
to C<copy>, so no decoding-filtering-encoding operations will occur, or I<can> occur.
Packets of selected streams shall be conveyed from the input file and muxed within the output
file.


=head4 Example: automatic subtitles selection

	
	ffmpeg -i C.mkv out1.mkv -c:s dvdsub -an out2.mkv

Although F<out1.mkv> is a Matroska container file which accepts subtitle streams, only a
video and audio stream shall be selected. The subtitle stream of F<C.mkv> is image-based
and the default subtitle encoder of the Matroska muxer is text-based, so a transcode operation
for the subtitles is expected to fail and hence the stream isn't selected. However, in
F<out2.mkv>, a subtitle encoder is specified in the command and so, the subtitle stream is
selected, in addition to the video stream. The presence of C<-an> disables audio stream
selection for F<out2.mkv>.


=head4 Example: unlabeled filtergraph outputs

	
	ffmpeg -i A.avi -i C.mkv -i B.mp4 -filter_complex "overlay" out1.mp4 out2.srt

A filtergraph is setup here using the C<-filter_complex> option and consists of a single
video filter. The C<overlay> filter requires exactly two video inputs, but none are
specified, so the first two available video streams are used, those of F<A.avi> and
F<C.mkv>. The output pad of the filter has no label and so is sent to the first output file
F<out1.mp4>. Due to this, automatic selection of the video stream is skipped, which would
have selected the stream in F<B.mp4>. The audio stream with most channels viz. C<stream 3>
in F<B.mp4>, is chosen automatically. No subtitle stream is chosen however, since the MP4
format has no default subtitle encoder registered, and the user hasn't specified a subtitle encoder.

The 2nd output file, F<out2.srt>, only accepts text-based subtitle streams. So, even though
the first subtitle stream available belongs to F<C.mkv>, it is image-based and hence skipped.
The selected stream, C<stream 2> in F<B.mp4>, is the first text-based subtitle stream.


=head4 Example: labeled filtergraph outputs

	
	ffmpeg -i A.avi -i B.mp4 -i C.mkv -filter_complex "[1:v]hue=s=0[outv];overlay;aresample" \
	       -map '[outv]' -an        out1.mp4 \
	                                out2.mkv \
	       -map '[outv]' -map 1:a:0 out3.mkv


The above command will fail, as the output pad labelled C<[outv]> has been mapped twice.
None of the output files shall be processed.

	
	ffmpeg -i A.avi -i B.mp4 -i C.mkv -filter_complex "[1:v]hue=s=0[outv];overlay;aresample" \
	       -an        out1.mp4 \
	                  out2.mkv \
	       -map 1:a:0 out3.mkv


This command above will also fail as the hue filter output has a label, C<[outv]>,
and hasn't been mapped anywhere.

The command should be modified as follows,
	
	ffmpeg -i A.avi -i B.mp4 -i C.mkv -filter_complex "[1:v]hue=s=0,split=2[outv1][outv2];overlay;aresample" \
	        -map '[outv1]' -an        out1.mp4 \
	                                  out2.mkv \
	        -map '[outv2]' -map 1:a:0 out3.mkv

The video stream from F<B.mp4> is sent to the hue filter, whose output is cloned once using
the split filter, and both outputs labelled. Then a copy each is mapped to the first and third
output files.

The overlay filter, requiring two video inputs, uses the first two unused video streams. Those
are the streams from F<A.avi> and F<C.mkv>. The overlay output isn't labelled, so it is
sent to the first output file F<out1.mp4>, regardless of the presence of the C<-map> option.

The aresample filter is sent the first unused audio stream, that of F<A.avi>. Since this filter
output is also unlabelled, it too is mapped to the first output file. The presence of C<-an>
only suppresses automatic or manual stream selection of audio streams, not outputs sent from
filtergraphs. Both these mapped streams shall be ordered before the mapped stream in F<out1.mp4>.

The video, audio and subtitle streams mapped to C<out2.mkv> are entirely determined by
automatic stream selection.

F<out3.mkv> consists of the cloned video output from the hue filter and the first audio
stream from F<B.mp4>.

=head1 OPTIONS


All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo"
will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.



=head2 Stream specifiers

Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.

A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. C<-codec:a:1 ac3> contains the
C<a:1> stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in C<-b:a 128k> matches all audio
streams.

An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, C<-codec copy>
or C<-codec: copy> would copy all the streams without reencoding.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

=over 4


=item I<stream_index>

Matches the stream with this index. E.g. C<-threads:1 4> would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4. If I<stream_index> is used as an
additional stream specifier (see below), then it selects stream number
I<stream_index> from the matching streams. Stream numbering is based on the
order of the streams as detected by libavformat except when a program ID is
also specified. In this case it is based on the ordering of the streams in the
program.

=item I<stream_type>B<[:>I<additional_stream_specifier>B<]>

I<stream_type> is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's'
for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v' matches all video
streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video
thumbnails or cover arts. If I<additional_stream_specifier> is used, then
it matches streams which both have this type and match the
I<additional_stream_specifier>. Otherwise, it matches all streams of the
specified type.

=item B<p:>I<program_id>B<[:>I<additional_stream_specifier>B<]>

Matches streams which are in the program with the id I<program_id>. If
I<additional_stream_specifier> is used, then it matches streams which both
are part of the program and match the I<additional_stream_specifier>.


=item B<#>I<stream_id> B<or i:>I<stream_id>

Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

=item B<m:>I<key>B<[:>I<value>B<]>

Matches streams with the metadata tag I<key> having the specified value. If
I<value> is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.

=item B<u>

Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the
essential information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present.

Note that in B<ffmpeg>, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.

flag without affecting other I<flags> or changing I<loglevel>. When
setting both I<flags> and I<loglevel>, a '+' separator is expected
between the last I<flags> value and before I<loglevel>.

I<loglevel> is a string or a number containing one of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<quiet, -8>

Show nothing at all; be silent.

=item B<panic, 0>

Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as
an assertion failure. This is not currently used for anything.

=item B<fatal, 8>

Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely
cannot continue.

=item B<error, 16>

Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

=item B<warning, 24>

Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly
incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

=item B<info, 32>

Show informative messages during processing. This is in addition to
warnings and errors. This is the default value.

=item B<verbose, 40>

Same as C<info>, except more verbose.

=item B<debug, 48>

Show everything, including debugging information.

=item B<trace, 56>


=back


For example to enable repeated log output, add the C<level> prefix, and set
I<loglevel> to C<verbose>:
	
	ffmpeg -loglevel repeat+level+verbose -i input output

Another example that enables repeated log output without affecting current
state of C<level> prefix flag or I<loglevel>:
	
	ffmpeg [...] -loglevel +repeat


By default the program logs to stderr. If coloring is supported by the
terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring
can be disabled setting the environment variable
B<AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR>, or can be forced setting
the environment variable B<AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR>.


=item B<-report>

Dump full command line and log output to a file named
C<I<program>-I<YYYYMMDD>-I<HHMMSS>.log> in the current
directory.
This file can be useful for bug reports.
It also implies C<-loglevel debug>.

Setting the environment variable B<FFREPORT> to any value has the
same effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence, these
options will affect the report; option values must be escaped if they
contain special characters or the options delimiter ':' (see the
``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

The following options are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<file>

set the file name to use for the report; C<%p> is expanded to the name
of the program, C<%t> is expanded to a timestamp, C<%%> is expanded
to a plain C<%>

=item B<level>

set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see C<-loglevel>).

=back


For example, to output a report to a file named F<ffreport.log>
using a log level of C<32> (alias for log level C<info>):

	
	FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output


Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will not
appear in the report.


=item B<-hide_banner>

Suppress printing banner.

All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build options
and library versions. This option can be used to suppress printing
this information.


=item B<-cpuflags flags (>I<global>B<)>

Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended
for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.
	
	ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
	ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
	ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

Possible flags for this option are:

=item B<-max_alloc> I<bytes>

Set the maximum size limit for allocating a block on the heap by ffmpeg's
family of malloc functions. Exercise B<extreme caution> when using
this option. Don't use if you do not understand the full consequence of doing so.
Default is INT_MAX.

=back



=head2 AVOptions


These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
B<-help> option. They are separated into two categories:

=over 4


=item B<generic>

These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.

=item B<private>

These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.

=back


For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an MP3 file, use the B<id3v2_version> private option of the MP3
muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3


All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier
should be attached to them:
	
	ffmpeg -i multichannel.mxf -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -map 0:a:0 -c:a:0 ac3 -b:a:0 640k -ac:a:1 2 -c:a:1 aac -b:2 128k out.mp4


In the above example, a multichannel audio stream is mapped twice for output.
The first instance is encoded with codec ac3 and bitrate 640k.
The second instance is downmixed to 2 channels and encoded with codec aac. A bitrate of 128k is specified for it using
absolute index of the output stream.

Note: the B<-nooption> syntax cannot be used for boolean
AVOptions, use B<-option 0>/B<-option 1>.

Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
removed soon.


=head2 Main options



=over 4



=item B<-f> I<fmt> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Force input or output file format. The format is normally auto detected for input
files and guessed from the file extension for output files, so this option is not
needed in most cases.


=item B<-i> I<url> B<(>I<input>B<)>

input file url


=item B<-y (>I<global>B<)>

Overwrite output files without asking.


=item B<-n (>I<global>B<)>

Do not overwrite output files, and exit immediately if a specified
output file already exists.


=item B<-stream_loop> I<number> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set number of times input stream shall be looped. Loop 0 means no loop,
loop -1 means infinite loop.


=item B<-c[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<codec> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>


=item B<-codec[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<codec> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>

Select an encoder (when used before an output file) or a decoder (when used
before an input file) for one or more streams. I<codec> is the name of a
decoder/encoder or a special value C<copy> (output only) to indicate that
the stream is not to be re-encoded.

For example
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy OUTPUT

encodes all video streams with libx264 and copies all audio streams.

For each stream, the last matching C<c> option is applied, so
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -c copy -c:v:1 libx264 -c:a:137 libvorbis OUTPUT

will copy all the streams except the second video, which will be encoded with
libx264, and the 138th audio, which will be encoded with libvorbis.


=item B<-t> I<duration> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

When used as an input option (before C<-i>), limit the I<duration> of
data read from the input file.

When used as an output option (before an output url), stop writing the
output after its duration reaches I<duration>.

I<duration> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

-to and -t are mutually exclusive and -t has priority.


=item B<-to> I<position> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Stop writing the output or reading the input at I<position>.
I<position> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

-to and -t are mutually exclusive and -t has priority.


=item B<-fs> I<limit_size> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the file size limit, expressed in bytes. No further chunk of bytes is written
after the limit is exceeded. The size of the output file is slightly more than the
requested file size.


=item B<-ss> I<position> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

When used as an input option (before C<-i>), seeks in this input file to
I<position>. Note that in most formats it is not possible to seek exactly,
so B<ffmpeg> will seek to the closest seek point before I<position>.
When transcoding and B<-accurate_seek> is enabled (the default), this
extra segment between the seek point and I<position> will be decoded and
discarded. When doing stream copy or when B<-noaccurate_seek> is used, it
will be preserved.

When used as an output option (before an output url), decodes but discards
input until the timestamps reach I<position>.

I<position> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.


=item B<-sseof> I<position> B<(>I<input>B<)>


Like the C<-ss> option but relative to the "end of file". That is negative
values are earlier in the file, 0 is at EOF.


=item B<-itsoffset> I<offset> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set the input time offset.

I<offset> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

The offset is added to the timestamps of the input files. Specifying
a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are delayed by
the time duration specified in I<offset>.


=item B<-itsscale> I<scale> B<(>I<input,per-stream>B<)>

Rescale input timestamps. I<scale> should be a floating point number.


=item B<-timestamp> I<date> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the recording timestamp in the container.

I<date> must be a date specification,
see B<the Date section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.


=item B<-metadata[:metadata_specifier]> I<key>B<=>I<value> B<(>I<output,per-metadata>B<)>

Set a metadata key/value pair.

An optional I<metadata_specifier> may be given to set metadata
on streams, chapters or programs. See C<-map_metadata>
documentation for details.

This option overrides metadata set with C<-map_metadata>. It is
also possible to delete metadata by using an empty value.

For example, for setting the title in the output file:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -metadata title="my title" out.flv


To set the language of the first audio stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -metadata:s:a:0 language=eng OUTPUT



=item B<-disposition[:stream_specifier]> I<value> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Sets the disposition for a stream.

This option overrides the disposition copied from the input stream. It is also
possible to delete the disposition by setting it to 0.

The following dispositions are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<default>


=item B<dub>


=item B<original>


=item B<comment>


=item B<lyrics>


=item B<karaoke>


=item B<forced>

=item B<dependent>


=item B<metadata>


=back


For example, to make the second audio stream the default stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.mkv -c copy -disposition:a:1 default out.mkv


To make the second subtitle stream the default stream and remove the default
disposition from the first subtitle stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.mkv -c copy -disposition:s:0 0 -disposition:s:1 default out.mkv


To add an embedded cover/thumbnail:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -i IMAGE -map 0 -map 1 -c copy -c:v:1 png -disposition:v:1 attached_pic out.mp4


Not all muxers support embedded thumbnails, and those who do, only support a few formats, like JPEG or PNG.


=item B<-program [title=>I<title>B<:][program_num=>I<program_num>B<:]st=>I<stream>B<[:st=>I<stream>B<...] (>I<output>B<)>


Creates a program with the specified I<title>, I<program_num> and adds the specified
I<stream>(s) to it.


=item B<-target> I<type> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Specify target file type (C<vcd>, C<svcd>, C<dvd>, C<dv>,
C<dv50>). I<type> may be prefixed with C<pal->, C<ntsc-> or
C<film-> to use the corresponding standard. All the format options
(bitrate, codecs, buffer sizes) are then set automatically. You can just type:

	
	ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg


Nevertheless you can specify additional options as long as you know
they do not conflict with the standard, as in:

	
	ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd -bf 2 /tmp/vcd.mpg


The parameters set for each target are as follows.

The C<dv50> target is identical to the C<dv> target except that the pixel format set is C<yuv422p> for all three standards.

Any user-set value for a parameter above will override the target preset value. In that case, the output may
not comply with the target standard.


=item B<-dn (>I<input/output>B<)>

As an input option, blocks all data streams of a file from being filtered or
being automatically selected or mapped for any output. See C<-discard>
option to disable streams individually.

As an output option, disables data recording i.e. automatic selection or
mapping of any data stream. For full manual control see the C<-map>
option.


=item B<-dframes> I<number> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the number of data frames to output. This is an obsolete alias for
C<-frames:d>, which you should use instead.


=item B<-frames[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<framecount> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Stop writing to the stream after I<framecount> frames.


=item B<-q[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<q> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>


=item B<-qscale[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<q> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Use fixed quality scale (VBR). The meaning of I<q>/I<qscale> is
codec-dependent.
If I<qscale> is used without a I<stream_specifier> then it applies only
to the video stream, this is to maintain compatibility with previous behavior
and as specifying the same codec specific value to 2 different codecs that is
audio and video generally is not what is intended when no stream_specifier is
used.



=item B<-filter[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<filtergraph> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Create the filtergraph specified by I<filtergraph> and use it to
filter the stream.

I<filtergraph> is a description of the filtergraph to apply to
the stream, and must have a single input and a single output of the
same type of the stream. In the filtergraph, the input is associated
to the label C<in>, and the output to the label C<out>. See
the ffmpeg-filters manual for more information about the filtergraph
syntax.

See the B<-filter_complex option> if you
want to create filtergraphs with multiple inputs and/or outputs.


=item B<-filter_script[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<filename> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

This option is similar to B<-filter>, the only difference is that its
argument is the name of the file from which a filtergraph description is to be
read.


=item B<-filter_threads> I<nb_threads> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Defines how many threads are used to process a filter pipeline. Each pipeline
will produce a thread pool with this many threads available for parallel processing.
The default is the number of available CPUs.


=item B<-pre[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<preset_name> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Specify the preset for matching stream(s).


=item B<-stats (>I<global>B<)>

Print encoding progress/statistics. It is on by default, to explicitly
disable it you need to specify C<-nostats>.


=item B<-stats_period> I<time> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Set period at which encoding progress/statistics are updated. Default is 0.5 seconds.


=item B<-progress> I<url> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Send program-friendly progress information to I<url>.

Progress information is written periodically and at the end of
the encoding process. It is made of "I<key>=I<value>" lines. I<key>
consists of only alphanumeric characters. The last key of a sequence of
progress information is always "progress".

The update period is set using C<-stats_period>.



=item B<-stdin>

Enable interaction on standard input. On by default unless standard input is
used as an input. To explicitly disable interaction you need to specify
C<-nostdin>.

Disabling interaction on standard input is useful, for example, if
ffmpeg is in the background process group. Roughly the same result can
be achieved with C<ffmpeg ... E<lt> /dev/null> but it requires a
shell.


=item B<-debug_ts (>I<global>B<)>

Print timestamp information. It is off by default. This option is
mostly useful for testing and debugging purposes, and the output
format may change from one version to another, so it should not be
employed by portable scripts.

See also the option C<-fdebug ts>.


=item B<-attach> I<filename> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Add an attachment to the output file. This is supported by a few formats
like Matroska for e.g. fonts used in rendering subtitles. Attachments
are implemented as a specific type of stream, so this option will add
a new stream to the file. It is then possible to use per-stream options
on this stream in the usual way. Attachment streams created with this
option will be created after all the other streams (i.e. those created
with C<-map> or automatic mappings).

Note that for Matroska you also have to set the mimetype metadata tag:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -attach DejaVuSans.ttf -metadata:s:2 mimetype=application/x-truetype-font out.mkv

(assuming that the attachment stream will be third in the output file).


=item B<-dump_attachment[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<filename> B<(>I<input,per-stream>B<)>

Extract the matching attachment stream into a file named I<filename>. If
I<filename> is empty, then the value of the C<filename> metadata tag
will be used.

E.g. to extract the first attachment to a file named 'out.ttf':
	
	ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t:0 out.ttf -i INPUT

To extract all attachments to files determined by the C<filename> tag:
	
	ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t "" -i INPUT


Technical note -- attachments are implemented as codec extradata, so this
option can actually be used to extract extradata from any stream, not just
attachments.

=back



=head2 Video Options



=over 4


=item B<-vframes> I<number> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the number of video frames to output. This is an obsolete alias for
C<-frames:v>, which you should use instead.

=item B<-r[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<fps> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>

Set frame rate (Hz value, fraction or abbreviation).

As an input option, ignore any timestamps stored in the file and instead
generate timestamps assuming constant frame rate I<fps>.
This is not the same as the B<-framerate> option used for some input formats
like image2 or v4l2 (it used to be the same in older versions of FFmpeg).
If in doubt use B<-framerate> instead of the input option B<-r>.

As an output option, duplicate or drop input frames to achieve constant output
frame rate I<fps>.


=item B<-fpsmax[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<fps> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Set maximum frame rate (Hz value, fraction or abbreviation).

Clamps output frame rate when output framerate is auto-set and is higher than this value.
Useful in batch processing or when input framerate is wrongly detected as very high.
It cannot be set together with C<-r>. It is ignored during streamcopy.


=item B<-s[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<size> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>

Set frame size.

As an input option, this is a shortcut for the B<video_size> private
option, recognized by some demuxers for which the frame size is either not
stored in the file or is configurable -- e.g. raw video or video grabbers.

As an output option, this inserts the C<scale> video filter to the
I<end> of the corresponding filtergraph. Please use the C<scale> filter
directly to insert it at the beginning or some other place.

The format is B<wxh> (default - same as source).


=item B<-aspect[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<aspect> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Set the video display aspect ratio specified by I<aspect>.

I<aspect> can be a floating point number string, or a string of the
form I<num>:I<den>, where I<num> and I<den> are the
numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. For example "4:3",
"16:9", "1.3333", and "1.7777" are valid argument values.

If used together with B<-vcodec copy>, it will affect the aspect ratio
stored at container level, but not the aspect ratio stored in encoded
frames, if it exists.


=item B<-vn (>I<input/output>B<)>

As an input option, blocks all video streams of a file from being filtered or
being automatically selected or mapped for any output. See C<-discard>
option to disable streams individually.

As an output option, disables video recording i.e. automatic selection or
mapping of any video stream. For full manual control see the C<-map>
option.


=item B<-vcodec> I<codec> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the video codec. This is an alias for C<-codec:v>.


=item B<-pass[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<n> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Select the pass number (1 or 2). It is used to do two-pass
video encoding. The statistics of the video are recorded in the first
pass into a log file (see also the option -passlogfile),
and in the second pass that log file is used to generate the video
at the exact requested bitrate.
On pass 1, you may just deactivate audio and set output to null,
examples for Windows and Unix:
	
	ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y NUL
	ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y /dev/null



=item B<-passlogfile[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<prefix> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Set two-pass log file name prefix to I<prefix>, the default file name
prefix is ``ffmpeg2pass''. The complete file name will be
F<PREFIX-N.log>, where N is a number specific to the output
stream


=item B<-vf> I<filtergraph> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Create the filtergraph specified by I<filtergraph> and use it to
filter the stream.

This is an alias for C<-filter:v>, see the B<-filter option>.


=item B<-autorotate>

Automatically rotate the video according to file metadata. Enabled by
default, use B<-noautorotate> to disable it.


=item B<-autoscale>

Automatically scale the video according to the resolution of first frame.
Enabled by default, use B<-noautoscale> to disable it. When autoscale is
disabled, all output frames of filter graph might not be in the same resolution
and may be inadequate for some encoder/muxer. Therefore, it is not recommended
to disable it unless you really know what you are doing.
Disable autoscale at your own risk.

=item B<-pix_fmt[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<format> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>

Set pixel format. Use C<-pix_fmts> to show all the supported
pixel formats.
If the selected pixel format can not be selected, ffmpeg will print a
warning and select the best pixel format supported by the encoder.
If I<pix_fmt> is prefixed by a C<+>, ffmpeg will exit with an error
if the requested pixel format can not be selected, and automatic conversions
inside filtergraphs are disabled.
If I<pix_fmt> is a single C<+>, ffmpeg selects the same pixel format
as the input (or graph output) and automatic conversions are disabled.


=item B<-sws_flags> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Set SwScaler flags.


=item B<-rc_override[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<override> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Rate control override for specific intervals, formatted as "int,int,int"
list separated with slashes. Two first values are the beginning and
end frame numbers, last one is quantizer to use if positive, or quality
factor if negative.


=item B<-ilme>

Force interlacing support in encoder (MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 only).
Use this option if your input file is interlaced and you want
to keep the interlaced format for minimum losses.
The alternative is to deinterlace the input stream by use of a filter
such as C<yadif> or C<bwdif>, but deinterlacing introduces losses.

=item B<-psnr>

Calculate PSNR of compressed frames.

=item B<-vstats>

Dump video coding statistics to F<vstats_HHMMSS.log>.

=item B<-vstats_file> I<file>

Dump video coding statistics to I<file>.

=item B<-vstats_version> I<file>

Specifies which version of the vstats format to use. Default is 2.

version = 1 :

C<frame= %5d q= %2.1f PSNR= %6.2f f_size= %6d s_size= %8.0fkB time= %0.3f br= %7.1fkbits/s avg_br= %7.1fkbits/s>

=item B<-force_key_frames[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<time>B<[,>I<time>B<...] (>I<output,per-stream>B<)>


=item B<-force_key_frames[:>I<stream_specifier>B<] expr:>I<expr> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>


=item B<-force_key_frames[:>I<stream_specifier>B<] source (>I<output,per-stream>B<)>


I<force_key_frames> can take arguments of the following form:


=over 4



=item I<time>B<[,>I<time>B<...]>

If the argument consists of timestamps, ffmpeg will round the specified times to the nearest
output timestamp as per the encoder time base and force a keyframe at the first frame having
timestamp equal or greater than the computed timestamp. Note that if the encoder time base is too
coarse, then the keyframes may be forced on frames with timestamps lower than the specified time.
The default encoder time base is the inverse of the output framerate but may be set otherwise
via C<-enc_time_base>.

If one of the times is "C<chapters>[I<delta>]", it is expanded into
the time of the beginning of all chapters in the file, shifted by
I<delta>, expressed as a time in seconds.
This option can be useful to ensure that a seek point is present at a
chapter mark or any other designated place in the output file.

For example, to insert a key frame at 5 minutes, plus key frames 0.1 second
before the beginning of every chapter:
	
	-force_key_frames 0:05:00,chapters-0.1



=item B<expr:>I<expr>

If the argument is prefixed with C<expr:>, the string I<expr>
is interpreted like an expression and is evaluated for each frame. A
key frame is forced in case the evaluation is non-zero.

The expression in I<expr> can contain the following constants:

=over 4


=item B<n>

the number of current processed frame, starting from 0

=item B<n_forced>

the number of forced frames

=item B<prev_forced_n>

the number of the previous forced frame, it is C<NAN> when no
keyframe was forced yet

=item B<prev_forced_t>

the time of the previous forced frame, it is C<NAN> when no
keyframe was forced yet

=item B<t>

the time of the current processed frame

=back


For example to force a key frame every 5 seconds, you can specify:
	
	-force_key_frames expr:gte(t,n_forced*5)


To force a key frame 5 seconds after the time of the last forced one,
starting from second 13:
	
	-force_key_frames expr:if(isnan(prev_forced_t),gte(t,13),gte(t,prev_forced_t+5))



=item B<source>

If the argument is C<source>, ffmpeg will force a key frame if
the current frame being encoded is marked as a key frame in its source.


=back


Note that forcing too many keyframes is very harmful for the lookahead
algorithms of certain encoders: using fixed-GOP options or similar
would be more efficient.


=item B<-copyinkf[:>I<stream_specifier>B<] (>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

When doing stream copy, copy also non-key frames found at the
beginning.


=item B<-init_hw_device> I<type>B<[=>I<name>B<][:>I<device>B<[,>I<key=value>B<...]]>

Initialise a new hardware device of type I<type> called I<name>, using the
given device parameters.
If no name is specified it will receive a default name of the form "I<type>%d".

The meaning of I<device> and the following arguments depends on the
device type:

=over 4



=item B<cuda>

I<device> is the number of the CUDA device.


=item B<dxva2>

I<device> is the number of the Direct3D 9 display adapter.


=item B<vaapi>

I<device> is either an X11 display name or a DRM render node.
If not specified, it will attempt to open the default X11 display (I<$DISPLAY>)
and then the first DRM render node (I</dev/dri/renderD128>).


=item B<vdpau>

I<device> is an X11 display name.
If not specified, it will attempt to open the default X11 display (I<$DISPLAY>).


=item B<qsv>

I<device> selects a value in B<MFX_IMPL_*>. Allowed values are:

=over 4


=item B<auto>


=item B<sw>


=item B<hw>


=item B<auto_any>


=item B<hw_any>


=item B<hw2>


=item B<hw3>


=item B<hw4>


=back

If not specified, B<auto_any> is used.
(Note that it may be easier to achieve the desired result for QSV by creating the
platform-appropriate subdevice (B<dxva2> or B<vaapi>) and then deriving a
QSV device from that.)


=item B<opencl>

I<device> selects the platform and device as I<platform_index.device_index>.

The set of devices can also be filtered using the key-value pairs to find only
devices matching particular platform or device strings.

The strings usable as filters are:

=over 4


=item B<platform_profile>


=item B<platform_version>


=item B<platform_name>


=item B<platform_vendor>


=item B<platform_extensions>


=item B<device_name>


=item B<device_vendor>


=item B<driver_version>


=item B<device_version>


=item B<device_profile>


=item B<device_extensions>


=item B<device_type>


=back


The indices and filters must together uniquely select a device.

Examples:

=over 4


=item I<-init_hw_device opencl:0.1>

Choose the second device on the first platform.


=item I<-init_hw_device opencl:,device_name=Foo9000>

Choose the device with a name containing the string I<Foo9000>.


=item I<-init_hw_device opencl:1,device_type=gpu,device_extensions=cl_khr_fp16>

Choose the GPU device on the second platform supporting the I<cl_khr_fp16>
extension.

=back



=item B<vulkan>

If I<device> is an integer, it selects the device by its index in a
system-dependent list of devices.  If I<device> is any other string, it
selects the first device with a name containing that string as a substring.

The following options are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<debug>

If set to 1, enables the validation layer, if installed.

=item B<linear_images>

If set to 1, images allocated by the hwcontext will be linear and locally mappable.

=item B<instance_extensions>

A plus separated list of additional instance extensions to enable.

=item B<device_extensions>

A plus separated list of additional device extensions to enable.

=back


Examples:

=over 4


=item I<-init_hw_device vulkan:1>

=item B<-init_hw_device> I<type>B<[=>I<name>B<]@>I<source>

Initialise a new hardware device of type I<type> called I<name>,
deriving it from the existing device with the name I<source>.


=item B<-init_hw_device list>

List all hardware device types supported in this build of ffmpeg.


=item B<-filter_hw_device> I<name>

Pass the hardware device called I<name> to all filters in any filter graph.
This can be used to set the device to upload to with the C<hwupload> filter,
or the device to map to with the C<hwmap> filter.  Other filters may also
make use of this parameter when they require a hardware device.  Note that this
is typically only required when the input is not already in hardware frames -
when it is, filters will derive the device they require from the context of the
frames they receive as input.

This is a global setting, so all filters will receive the same device.


=item B<-hwaccel[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<hwaccel> B<(>I<input,per-stream>B<)>

Use hardware acceleration to decode the matching stream(s). The allowed values
of I<hwaccel> are:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do not use any hardware acceleration (the default).


=item B<auto>

Automatically select the hardware acceleration method.


=item B<vdpau>

Use VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) hardware acceleration.


=item B<dxva2>

Use DXVA2 (DirectX Video Acceleration) hardware acceleration.


=item B<vaapi>

Use VAAPI (Video Acceleration API) hardware acceleration.


=item B<qsv>

Use the Intel QuickSync Video acceleration for video transcoding.

Unlike most other values, this option does not enable accelerated decoding (that
is used automatically whenever a qsv decoder is selected), but accelerated
transcoding, without copying the frames into the system memory.

For it to work, both the decoder and the encoder must support QSV acceleration
and no filters must be used.

=back


This option has no effect if the selected hwaccel is not available or not
supported by the chosen decoder.

Note that most acceleration methods are intended for playback and will not be
faster than software decoding on modern CPUs. Additionally, B<ffmpeg>
will usually need to copy the decoded frames from the GPU memory into the system
memory, resulting in further performance loss. This option is thus mainly
useful for testing.


=item B<-hwaccel_device[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<hwaccel_device> B<(>I<input,per-stream>B<)>

Select a device to use for hardware acceleration.

This option only makes sense when the B<-hwaccel> option is also specified.
It can either refer to an existing device created with B<-init_hw_device>
by name, or it can create a new device as if
B<-init_hw_device> I<type>:I<hwaccel_device>
were called immediately before.


=item B<-hwaccels>

C<-frames:a>, which you should use instead.

=item B<-ar[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<freq> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>

Set the audio sampling frequency. For output streams it is set by
default to the frequency of the corresponding input stream. For input
streams this option only makes sense for audio grabbing devices and raw
demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer options.

=item B<-aq> I<q> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the audio quality (codec-specific, VBR). This is an alias for -q:a.

=item B<-ac[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<channels> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>

Set the number of audio channels. For output streams it is set by

this option only makes sense for audio grabbing devices and raw demuxers
and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer options.

=item B<-an (>I<input/output>B<)>

As an input option, blocks all audio streams of a file from being filtered or

=head2 Advanced Subtitle options



=over 4



=item B<-fix_sub_duration>

Fix subtitles durations. For each subtitle, wait for the next packet in the
same stream and adjust the duration of the first to avoid overlap. This is
necessary with some subtitles codecs, especially DVB subtitles, because the
duration in the original packet is only a rough estimate and the end is
actually marked by an empty subtitle frame. Failing to use this option when
necessary can result in exaggerated durations or muxing failures due to
non-monotonic timestamps.

Note that this option will delay the output of all data until the next
subtitle packet is decoded: it may increase memory consumption and latency a
lot.


=item B<-canvas_size> I<size>

Set the size of the canvas used to render subtitles.

=item B<-map [-]>I<input_file_id>B<[:>I<stream_specifier>B<][?][,>I<sync_file_id>B<[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]] |> I<[linklabel]> B<(>I<output>B<)>


Designate one or more input streams as a source for the output file. Each input
stream is identified by the input file index I<input_file_id> and
the input stream index I<input_stream_id> within the input
file. Both indices start at 0. If specified,
I<sync_file_id>:I<stream_specifier> sets which input stream
is used as a presentation sync reference.

The first C<-map> option on the command line specifies the
source for output stream 0, the second C<-map> option specifies
the source for output stream 1, etc.

A C<-> character before the stream identifier creates a "negative" mapping.
It disables matching streams from already created mappings.

A trailing C<?> after the stream index will allow the map to be
optional: if the map matches no streams the map will be ignored instead
of failing. Note the map will still fail if an invalid input file index
is used; such as if the map refers to a non-existent input.

An alternative I<[linklabel]> form will map outputs from complex filter
graphs (see the B<-filter_complex> option) to the output file.
I<linklabel> must correspond to a defined output link label in the graph.

For example, to map ALL streams from the first input file to output
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 output


For example, if you have two audio streams in the first input file,
these streams are identified by "0:0" and "0:1". You can use
C<-map> to select which streams to place in an output file. For
example:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:1 out.wav

will map the input stream in F<INPUT> identified by "0:1" to
the (single) output stream in F<out.wav>.

For example, to select the stream with index 2 from input file
F<a.mov> (specified by the identifier "0:2"), and stream with
index 6 from input F<b.mov> (specified by the identifier "1:6"),
and copy them to the output file F<out.mov>:
	
	ffmpeg -i a.mov -i b.mov -c copy -map 0:2 -map 1:6 out.mov


To select all video and the third audio stream from an input file:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 OUTPUT


To map all the streams except the second audio, use negative mappings
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -map -0:a:1 OUTPUT


To map the video and audio streams from the first input, and using the
trailing C<?>, ignore the audio mapping if no audio streams exist in
the first input:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:v -map 0:a? OUTPUT


To pick the English audio stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:m:language:eng OUTPUT


Note that using this option disables the default mappings for this output file.


=item B<-ignore_unknown>

Ignore input streams with unknown type instead of failing if copying
such streams is attempted.


=item B<-copy_unknown>

Allow input streams with unknown type to be copied instead of failing if copying
such streams is attempted.


=item B<-map_channel [>I<input_file_id>B<.>I<stream_specifier>B<.>I<channel_id>B<|-1][?][:>I<output_file_id>B<.>I<stream_specifier>B<]>

Map an audio channel from a given input to an output. If
I<output_file_id>.I<stream_specifier> is not set, the audio channel will
be mapped on all the audio streams.

Using "-1" instead of
I<input_file_id>.I<stream_specifier>.I<channel_id> will map a muted
channel.

A trailing C<?> will allow the map_channel to be
optional: if the map_channel matches no channel the map_channel will be ignored instead
of failing.

For example, assuming I<INPUT> is a stereo audio file, you can switch the
two audio channels with the following command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.1 -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT


If you want to mute the first channel and keep the second:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel -1 -map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT


The order of the "-map_channel" option specifies the order of the channels in
the output stream. The output channel layout is guessed from the number of
channels mapped (mono if one "-map_channel", stereo if two, etc.). Using "-ac"
in combination of "-map_channel" makes the channel gain levels to be updated if
input and output channel layouts don't match (for instance two "-map_channel"
options and "-ac 6").

You can also extract each channel of an input to specific outputs; the following
command extracts two channels of the I<INPUT> audio stream (file 0, stream 0)
to the respective I<OUTPUT_CH0> and I<OUTPUT_CH1> outputs:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT_CH0 -map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT_CH1


The following example splits the channels of a stereo input into two separate
streams, which are put into the same output file:
	
	ffmpeg -i stereo.wav -map 0:0 -map 0:0 -map_channel 0.0.0:0.0 -map_channel 0.0.1:0.1 -y out.ogg


Note that currently each output stream can only contain channels from a single
input stream; you can't for example use "-map_channel" to pick multiple input
audio channels contained in different streams (from the same or different files)
and merge them into a single output stream. It is therefore not currently
possible, for example, to turn two separate mono streams into a single stereo
stream. However splitting a stereo stream into two single channel mono streams
is possible.

If you need this feature, a possible workaround is to use the I<amerge>
filter. For example, if you need to merge a media (here F<input.mkv>) with 2
mono audio streams into one single stereo channel audio stream (and keep the
video stream), you can use the following command:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex "[0:1] [0:2] amerge" -c:a pcm_s16le -c:v copy output.mkv


To map the first two audio channels from the first input, and using the
trailing C<?>, ignore the audio channel mapping if the first input is
mono instead of stereo:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.0 -map_channel 0.0.1? OUTPUT



=item B<-map_metadata[:>I<metadata_spec_out>B<]> I<infile>B<[:>I<metadata_spec_in>B<] (>I<output,per-metadata>B<)>

Set metadata information of the next output file from I<infile>. Note that
those are file indices (zero-based), not filenames.
Optional I<metadata_spec_in/out> parameters specify, which metadata to copy.
A metadata specifier can have the following forms:

=over 4


=item I<g>

global metadata, i.e. metadata that applies to the whole file


=item I<s>B<[:>I<stream_spec>B<]>

per-stream metadata. I<stream_spec> is a stream specifier as described
in the B<Stream specifiers> chapter. In an input metadata specifier, the first
matching stream is copied from. In an output metadata specifier, all matching
streams are copied to.


=item I<c>B<:>I<chapter_index>

per-chapter metadata. I<chapter_index> is the zero-based chapter index.


=item I<p>B<:>I<program_index>

per-program metadata. I<program_index> is the zero-based program index.

=back

If metadata specifier is omitted, it defaults to global.

By default, global metadata is copied from the first input file,
per-stream and per-chapter metadata is copied along with streams/chapters. These
default mappings are disabled by creating any mapping of the relevant type. A negative
file index can be used to create a dummy mapping that just disables automatic copying.

For example to copy metadata from the first stream of the input file to global metadata
of the output file:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.ogg -map_metadata 0:s:0 out.mp3


To do the reverse, i.e. copy global metadata to all audio streams:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.mkv -map_metadata:s:a 0:g out.mkv

Note that simple C<0> would work as well in this example, since global
metadata is assumed by default.


=item B<-map_chapters> I<input_file_index> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Copy chapters from input file with index I<input_file_index> to the next
output file. If no chapter mapping is specified, then chapters are copied from
the first input file with at least one chapter. Use a negative file index to
disable any chapter copying.


=item B<-benchmark (>I<global>B<)>

Show benchmarking information at the end of an encode.
Shows real, system and user time used and maximum memory consumption.
Maximum memory consumption is not supported on all systems,
it will usually display as 0 if not supported.

=item B<-benchmark_all (>I<global>B<)>

Show benchmarking information during the encode.
Shows real, system and user time used in various steps (audio/video encode/decode).

=item B<-timelimit> I<duration> B<(>I<global>B<)>

=item B<-dump (>I<global>B<)>

Dump each input packet to stderr.

=item B<-hex (>I<global>B<)>

When dumping packets, also dump the payload.

=item B<-re (>I<input>B<)>

Read input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab device,
or live input stream (e.g. when reading from a file). Should not be used
with actual grab devices or live input streams (where it can cause packet
loss).
By default B<ffmpeg> attempts to read the input(s) as fast as possible.
This option will slow down the reading of the input(s) to the native frame rate
of the input(s). It is useful for real-time output (e.g. live streaming).

=item B<-vsync> I<parameter>

Video sync method.
For compatibility reasons old values can be specified as numbers.
Newly added values will have to be specified as strings always.


=over 4


=item B<0, passthrough>

Each frame is passed with its timestamp from the demuxer to the muxer.

=item B<1, cfr>

Frames will be duplicated and dropped to achieve exactly the requested
constant frame rate.

=item B<2, vfr>

Frames are passed through with their timestamp or dropped so as to
prevent 2 frames from having the same timestamp.

=item B<drop>

As passthrough but destroys all timestamps, making the muxer generate
fresh timestamps based on frame-rate.

=item B<-1, auto>

Chooses between 1 and 2 depending on muxer capabilities. This is the
default method.

=back


Note that the timestamps may be further modified by the muxer, after this.
For example, in the case that the format option B<avoid_negative_ts>
is enabled.

With -map you can select from which stream the timestamps should be
taken. You can leave either video or audio unchanged and sync the
remaining stream(s) to the unchanged one.


=item B<-frame_drop_threshold> I<parameter>

Frame drop threshold, which specifies how much behind video frames can
be before they are dropped. In frame rate units, so 1.0 is one frame.
The default is -1.1. One possible usecase is to avoid framedrops in case
of noisy timestamps or to increase frame drop precision in case of exact
timestamps.


=item B<-async> I<samples_per_second>

Audio sync method. "Stretches/squeezes" the audio stream to match the timestamps,
the parameter is the maximum samples per second by which the audio is changed.
-async 1 is a special case where only the start of the audio stream is corrected
without any later correction.

Note that the timestamps may be further modified by the muxer, after this.
For example, in the case that the format option B<avoid_negative_ts>
is enabled.

This option has been deprecated. Use the C<aresample> audio filter instead.


=item B<-adrift_threshold> I<time>

Set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in seconds) to trigger
adding/dropping samples to make it match the timestamps. This option effectively is
a threshold to select between hard (add/drop) and soft (squeeze/stretch) compensation.
C<-async> must be set to a positive value.


=item B<-apad> I<parameters> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Pad the output audio stream(s). This is the same as applying C<-af apad>.
Argument is a string of filter parameters composed the same as with the C<apad> filter.
C<-shortest> must be set for this output for the option to take effect.


=item B<-copyts>

Do not process input timestamps, but keep their values without trying
to sanitize them. In particular, do not remove the initial start time
offset value.

Note that, depending on the B<vsync> option or on specific muxer
processing (e.g. in case the format option B<avoid_negative_ts>
is enabled) the output timestamps may mismatch with the input
timestamps even when this option is selected.


=item B<-start_at_zero>

When used with B<copyts>, shift input timestamps so they start at zero.

This means that using e.g. C<-ss 50> will make output timestamps start at
50 seconds, regardless of what timestamp the input file started at.


=item B<-copytb> I<mode>

Specify how to set the encoder timebase when stream copying.  I<mode> is an
integer numeric value, and can assume one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<1>

Use the demuxer timebase.

The time base is copied to the output encoder from the corresponding input
demuxer. This is sometimes required to avoid non monotonically increasing
timestamps when copying video streams with variable frame rate.


=item B<0>

Use the decoder timebase.

The time base is copied to the output encoder from the corresponding input
decoder.


=item B<-1>

Try to make the choice automatically, in order to generate a sane output.

=back


Default value is -1.


=item B<-enc_time_base[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<timebase> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Set the encoder timebase. I<timebase> is a floating point number,
and can assume one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<0>

Assign a default value according to the media type.

For video - use 1/framerate, for audio - use 1/samplerate.


=item B<-1>

Use the input stream timebase when possible.

If an input stream is not available, the default timebase will be used.


=item B<E<gt>0>

Use the provided number as the timebase.

This field can be provided as a ratio of two integers (e.g. 1:24, 1:48000)
or as a floating point number (e.g. 0.04166, 2.0833e-5)

=back


Default value is 0.


=item B<-bitexact (>I<input/output>B<)>

Enable bitexact mode for (de)muxer and (de/en)coder

=item B<-shortest (>I<output>B<)>

Finish encoding when the shortest input stream ends.

=item B<-dts_delta_threshold>

Timestamp discontinuity delta threshold.

=item B<-dts_error_threshold> I<seconds>

Timestamp error delta threshold. This threshold use to discard crazy/damaged
timestamps and the default is 30 hours which is arbitrarily picked and quite
conservative.

=item B<-muxdelay> I<seconds> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the maximum demux-decode delay.

=item B<-muxpreload> I<seconds> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the initial demux-decode delay.

=item B<-streamid> I<output-stream-index>B<:>I<new-value> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Assign a new stream-id value to an output stream. This option should be
specified prior to the output filename to which it applies.
For the situation where multiple output files exist, a streamid
may be reassigned to a different value.

For example, to set the stream 0 PID to 33 and the stream 1 PID to 36 for
an output mpegts file:
	
	ffmpeg -i inurl -streamid 0:33 -streamid 1:36 out.ts



=item B<-bsf[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<bitstream_filters> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

Set bitstream filters for matching streams. I<bitstream_filters> is
a comma-separated list of bitstream filters. Use the C<-bsfs> option
to get the list of bitstream filters.
	
	ffmpeg -i h264.mp4 -c:v copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -an out.h264

	
	ffmpeg -i file.mov -an -vn -bsf:s mov2textsub -c:s copy -f rawvideo sub.txt



=item B<-tag[:>I<stream_specifier>B<]> I<codec_tag> B<(>I<input/output,per-stream>B<)>

Force a tag/fourcc for matching streams.


=item B<-timecode> I<hh>B<:>I<mm>B<:>I<ss>B<SEP>I<ff>

Specify Timecode for writing. I<SEP> is ':' for non drop timecode and ';'
(or '.') for drop.
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mpg -timecode 01:02:03.04 -r 30000/1001 -s ntsc output.mpg




=item B<-filter_complex> I<filtergraph> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Define a complex filtergraph, i.e. one with arbitrary number of inputs and/or
outputs. For simple graphs -- those with one input and one output of the same
type -- see the B<-filter> options. I<filtergraph> is a description of
the filtergraph, as described in the ``Filtergraph syntax'' section of the
ffmpeg-filters manual.

Input link labels must refer to input streams using the
C<[file_index:stream_specifier]> syntax (i.e. the same as B<-map>
uses). If I<stream_specifier> matches multiple streams, the first one will be
used. An unlabeled input will be connected to the first unused input stream of
the matching type.

Output link labels are referred to with B<-map>. Unlabeled outputs are
added to the first output file.

Note that with this option it is possible to use only lavfi sources without
normal input files.

For example, to overlay an image over video
	
	ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex '[0:v][1:v]overlay[out]' -map
	'[out]' out.mkv

Here C<[0:v]> refers to the first video stream in the first input file,
which is linked to the first (main) input of the overlay filter. Similarly the
first video stream in the second input is linked to the second (overlay) input
of overlay.

Assuming there is only one video stream in each input file, we can omit input
labels, so the above is equivalent to
	
	ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay[out]' -map
	'[out]' out.mkv


Furthermore we can omit the output label and the single output from the filter
graph will be added to the output file automatically, so we can simply write
	
	ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay' out.mkv


As a special exception, you can use a bitmap subtitle stream as input: it
will be converted into a video with the same size as the largest video in
the file, or 720x576 if no video is present. Note that this is an
experimental and temporary solution. It will be removed once libavfilter has
proper support for subtitles.

For example, to hardcode subtitles on top of a DVB-T recording stored in
MPEG-TS format, delaying the subtitles by 1 second:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.ts -filter_complex \
	  '[#0x2ef] setpts=PTS+1/TB [sub] ; [#0x2d0] [sub] overlay' \
	  -sn -map '#0x2dc' output.mkv

(0x2d0, 0x2dc and 0x2ef are the MPEG-TS PIDs of respectively the video,
audio and subtitles streams; 0:0, 0:3 and 0:7 would have worked too)

To generate 5 seconds of pure red video using lavfi C<color> source:
	
	ffmpeg -filter_complex 'color=c=red' -t 5 out.mkv



=item B<-filter_complex_threads> I<nb_threads> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Defines how many threads are used to process a filter_complex graph.
Similar to filter_threads but used for C<-filter_complex> graphs only.
The default is the number of available CPUs.


=item B<-lavfi> I<filtergraph> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Define a complex filtergraph, i.e. one with arbitrary number of inputs and/or
outputs. Equivalent to B<-filter_complex>.


=item B<-filter_complex_script> I<filename> B<(>I<global>B<)>

This option is similar to B<-filter_complex>, the only difference is that
its argument is the name of the file from which a complex filtergraph
description is to be read.


=item B<-accurate_seek (>I<input>B<)>

This option enables or disables accurate seeking in input files with the
B<-ss> option. It is enabled by default, so seeking is accurate when
transcoding. Use B<-noaccurate_seek> to disable it, which may be useful
e.g. when copying some streams and transcoding the others.


=item B<-seek_timestamp (>I<input>B<)>

This option enables or disables seeking by timestamp in input files with the
B<-ss> option. It is disabled by default. If enabled, the argument
to the B<-ss> option is considered an actual timestamp, and is not
offset by the start time of the file. This matters only for files which do
not start from timestamp 0, such as transport streams.


=item B<-thread_queue_size> I<size> B<(>I<input>B<)>

This option sets the maximum number of queued packets when reading from the
file or device. With low latency / high rate live streams, packets may be
discarded if they are not read in a timely manner; setting this value can
force ffmpeg to use a separate input thread and read packets as soon as they
arrive. By default ffmpeg only do this if multiple inputs are specified.


=item B<-sdp_file> I<file> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Print sdp information for an output stream to I<file>.
This allows dumping sdp information when at least one output isn't an
rtp stream. (Requires at least one of the output formats to be rtp).


=item B<-discard (>I<input>B<)>

Allows discarding specific streams or frames from streams.
Any input stream can be fully discarded, using value C<all> whereas
selective discarding of frames from a stream occurs at the demuxer
and is not supported by all demuxers.


=over 4


=item B<none>

Discard no frame.


=item B<default>

Default, which discards no frames.


=item B<noref>

Discard all non-reference frames.


=item B<bidir>

Discard all bidirectional frames.


=item B<nokey>

Discard all frames excepts keyframes.


=item B<all>

Discard all frames.

=back



=item B<-abort_on> I<flags> B<(>I<global>B<)>

Stop and abort on various conditions. The following flags are available:


=over 4


=item B<empty_output>

No packets were passed to the muxer, the output is empty.

=item B<empty_output_stream>

No packets were passed to the muxer in some of the output streams.

=back



=item B<-max_error_rate (>I<global>B<)>

Set fraction of decoding frame failures across all inputs which when crossed
ffmpeg will return exit code 69. Crossing this threshold does not terminate
processing. Range is a floating-point number between 0 to 1. Default is 2/3.


=item B<-xerror (>I<global>B<)>

Stop and exit on error


=item B<-max_muxing_queue_size> I<packets> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

When transcoding audio and/or video streams, ffmpeg will not begin writing into
the output until it has one packet for each such stream. While waiting for that
to happen, packets for other streams are buffered. This option sets the size of
this buffer, in packets, for the matching output stream.

The default value of this option should be high enough for most uses, so only
touch this option if you are sure that you need it.


=item B<-muxing_queue_data_threshold> I<bytes> B<(>I<output,per-stream>B<)>

This is a minimum threshold until which the muxing queue size is not taken into
account. Defaults to 50 megabytes per stream, and is based on the overall size
of packets passed to the muxer.


=item B<-auto_conversion_filters (>I<global>B<)>

Enable automatically inserting format conversion filters in all filter
graphs, including those defined by B<-vf>, B<-af>,
B<-filter_complex> and B<-lavfi>. If filter format negotiation
requires a conversion, the initialization of the filters will fail.
Conversions can still be performed by inserting the relevant conversion
filter (scale, aresample) in the graph.
On by default, to explicitly disable it you need to specify
C<-noauto_conversion_filters>.


=back



=head2 Preset files

A preset file contains a sequence of I<option>=I<value> pairs,
one for each line, specifying a sequence of options which would be
awkward to specify on the command line. Lines starting with the hash
('#') character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Check
the F<presets> directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.

There are two types of preset files: ffpreset and avpreset files.


=head3 ffpreset files

ffpreset files are specified with the C<vpre>, C<apre>,
C<spre>, and C<fpre> options. The C<fpre> option takes the
filename of the preset instead of a preset name as input and can be
used for any kind of codec. For the C<vpre>, C<apre>, and
C<spre> options, the options specified in a preset file are
applied to the currently selected codec of the same type as the preset
option.

The argument passed to the C<vpre>, C<apre>, and C<spre>
preset options identifies the preset file to use according to the
following rules:

First ffmpeg searches for a file named I<arg>.ffpreset in the
directories F<$FFMPEG_DATADIR> (if set), and F<$HOME/.ffmpeg>, and in
the datadir defined at configuration time (usually F<PREFIX/share/ffmpeg>)
or in a F<ffpresets> folder along the executable on win32,
in that order. For example, if the argument is C<libvpx-1080p>, it will
search for the file F<libvpx-1080p.ffpreset>.

If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
I<codec_name>-I<arg>.ffpreset in the above-mentioned
directories, where I<codec_name> is the name of the codec to which
the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select
the video codec with C<-vcodec libvpx> and use C<-vpre 1080p>,
then it will search for the file F<libvpx-1080p.ffpreset>.


=head3 avpreset files

avpreset files are specified with the C<pre> option. They work similar to
ffpreset files, but they only allow encoder- specific options. Therefore, an
I<option>=I<value> pair specifying an encoder cannot be used.

When the C<pre> option is specified, ffmpeg will look for files with the
suffix .avpreset in the directories F<$AVCONV_DATADIR> (if set), and
F<$HOME/.avconv>, and in the datadir defined at configuration time (usually
F<PREFIX/share/ffmpeg>), in that order.

First ffmpeg searches for a file named I<codec_name>-I<arg>.avpreset in
the above-mentioned directories, where I<codec_name> is the name of the codec
to which the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select the
video codec with C<-vcodec libvpx> and use C<-pre 1080p>, then it will
search for the file F<libvpx-1080p.avpreset>.

If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
I<arg>.avpreset in the same directories.



=head1 EXAMPLES



=head2 Video and Audio grabbing


If you specify the input format and device then ffmpeg can grab video
and audio directly.

	
	ffmpeg -f oss -i /dev/dsp -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg


Or with an ALSA audio source (mono input, card id 1) instead of OSS:
	
	ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 1 -i hw:1 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg


Note that you must activate the right video source and channel before
launching ffmpeg with any TV viewer such as
E<lt>B<http://linux.bytesex.org/xawtv/>E<gt> by Gerd Knorr. You also
have to set the audio recording levels correctly with a
standard mixer.


=head2 X11 grabbing


Grab the X11 display with ffmpeg via

	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size cif -framerate 25 -i :0.0 /tmp/out.mpg


0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as
the DISPLAY environment variable.

	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size cif -framerate 25 -i :0.0+10,20 /tmp/out.mpg


0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY environment
variable. 10 is the x-offset and 20 the y-offset for the grabbing.


=head2 Video and Audio file format conversion


Any supported file format and protocol can serve as input to ffmpeg:

Examples:

=over 4


=item *

You can use YUV files as input:

	
	ffmpeg -i /tmp/test%d.Y /tmp/out.mpg


It will use the files:
	
	/tmp/test0.Y, /tmp/test0.U, /tmp/test0.V,
	/tmp/test1.Y, /tmp/test1.U, /tmp/test1.V, etc...


The Y files use twice the resolution of the U and V files. They are
raw files, without header. They can be generated by all decent video
decoders. You must specify the size of the image with the B<-s> option
if ffmpeg cannot guess it.


=item *

You can input from a raw YUV420P file:

	
	ffmpeg -i /tmp/test.yuv /tmp/out.avi


test.yuv is a file containing raw YUV planar data. Each frame is composed
of the Y plane followed by the U and V planes at half vertical and
horizontal resolution.


=item *

You can output to a raw YUV420P file:

	
	ffmpeg -i mydivx.avi hugefile.yuv



=item *

You can set several input files and output files:

	
	ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -s 640x480 -i /tmp/a.yuv /tmp/a.mpg


Converts the audio file a.wav and the raw YUV video file a.yuv
to MPEG file a.mpg.


=item *

You can also do audio and video conversions at the same time:

	
	ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -ar 22050 /tmp/a.mp2


Converts a.wav to MPEG audio at 22050 Hz sample rate.


=item *

You can encode to several formats at the same time and define a
mapping from input stream to output streams:

	
	ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -map 0:a -b:a 64k /tmp/a.mp2 -map 0:a -b:a 128k /tmp/b.mp2


Converts a.wav to a.mp2 at 64 kbits and to b.mp2 at 128 kbits. '-map
file:index' specifies which input stream is used for each output
stream, in the order of the definition of output streams.


=item *

You can transcode decrypted VOBs:

	
	ffmpeg -i snatch_1.vob -f avi -c:v mpeg4 -b:v 800k -g 300 -bf 2 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k snatch.avi


This is a typical DVD ripping example; the input is a VOB file, the
output an AVI file with MPEG-4 video and MP3 audio. Note that in this
command we use B-frames so the MPEG-4 stream is DivX5 compatible, and
GOP size is 300 which means one intra frame every 10 seconds for 29.97fps
input video. Furthermore, the audio stream is MP3-encoded so you need
to enable LAME support by passing C<--enable-libmp3lame> to configure.
The mapping is particularly useful for DVD transcoding
to get the desired audio language.

NOTE: To see the supported input formats, use C<ffmpeg -demuxers>.


=item *

You can extract images from a video, or create a video from many images:

For extracting images from a video:
	
	ffmpeg -i foo.avi -r 1 -s WxH -f image2 foo-%03d.jpeg


This will extract one video frame per second from the video and will
output them in files named F<foo-001.jpeg>, F<foo-002.jpeg>,
etc. Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values.

If you want to extract just a limited number of frames, you can use the
above command in combination with the C<-frames:v> or C<-t> option,
or in combination with -ss to start extracting from a certain point in time.

For creating a video from many images:
	
	ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 12 -i foo-%03d.jpeg -s WxH foo.avi


The syntax C<foo-%03d.jpeg> specifies to use a decimal number
composed of three digits padded with zeroes to express the sequence
number. It is the same syntax supported by the C printf function, but
only formats accepting a normal integer are suitable.

When importing an image sequence, -i also supports expanding
shell-like wildcard patterns (globbing) internally, by selecting the
image2-specific C<-pattern_type glob> option.

For example, for creating a video from filenames matching the glob pattern
C<foo-*.jpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -framerate 12 -i 'foo-*.jpeg' -s WxH foo.avi



=item *

You can put many streams of the same type in the output:

	
	ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -map 1:1 -map 1:0 -map 0:1 -map 0:0 -c copy -y test12.nut


The resulting output file F<test12.nut> will contain the first four streams
from the input files in reverse order.


=item *

To force CBR video output:
	
	ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -b 4000k -minrate 4000k -maxrate 4000k -bufsize 1835k out.m2v



=item *

The four options lmin, lmax, mblmin and mblmax use 'lambda' units,
but you may use the QP2LAMBDA constant to easily convert from 'q' units:
	
	ffmpeg -i src.ext -lmax 21*QP2LAMBDA dst.ext



=back



=head1 SYNTAX


This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
libraries and tools.



=head2 Quoting and escaping


FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:


=over 4


=item *

B<'> and B<\> are special characters (respectively used for
quoting and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other
special characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping
and quoting are employed.


=item *

A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a B<\>.


=item *

All characters enclosed between B<''> are included literally in the
parsed string. The quote character B<'> itself cannot be quoted,
so you may need to close the quote and escape it.


=item *

Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
removed from the parsed string.

=back


Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using
the command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the
adopted shell language.

The function C<av_get_token> defined in
F<libavutil/avstring.h> can be used to parse a token quoted or
escaped according to the rules defined above.

The tool F<tools/ffescape> in the FFmpeg source tree can be used
to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Escape the string C<Crime d'Amour> containing the C<'> special
character:
	
	Crime d\'Amour



=item *

The string above contains a quote, so the C<'> needs to be escaped
when quoting it:
	
	'Crime d'\''Amour'



=item *

Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
	
	'  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '



=item *

Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
	
	' The string '\'string\'' is a string '



=item *

To include a literal B<\> you can use either escaping or quoting:
	
	'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo


=back




=head2 Date


The accepted syntax is:
	
	[(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
	now


If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as UTC.
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year-month-day.



=head2 Time duration


There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.

	
	[-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]


I<HH> expresses the number of hours, I<MM> the number of minutes
for a maximum of 2 digits, and I<SS> the number of seconds for a
maximum of 2 digits. The I<m> at the end expresses decimal value for
I<SS>.

I<or>

	
	[-]<S>+[.<m>...][s|ms|us]


I<S> expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part
I<m>.  The optional literal suffixes B<s>, B<ms> or B<us>
indicate to interpret the value as seconds, milliseconds or microseconds,
respectively.

In both expressions, the optional B<-> indicates negative duration.


=head3 Examples


The following examples are all valid time duration:


=over 4


=item B<55>

55 seconds


=item B<0.2>

0.2 seconds


=item B<200ms>

200 milliseconds, that's 0.2s


=item B<200000us>

200000 microseconds, that's 0.2s


=item B<12:03:45>

12 hours, 03 minutes and 45 seconds


=item B<23.189>

23.189 seconds

=back




=head2 Video size

Specify the size of the sourced video, it may be a string of the form
I<width>xI<height>, or the name of a size abbreviation.

The following abbreviations are recognized:

=over 4

=head2 Video rate


Specify the frame rate of a video, expressed as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
I<frame_rate_num>/I<frame_rate_den>, an integer number, a float
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation.

The following abbreviations are recognized:

=over 4

=head2 Ratio


A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
I<numerator>:I<denominator>.

Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is
considered valid, so you should check on the returned value if you
want to exclude those values.

The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.



=head2 Color


It can be the name of a color as defined below (case insensitive match) or a
C<[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA]> sequence, possibly followed by @ and a string
representing the alpha component.

The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an
hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the opacity value (B<0x00> or B<0.0> means completely
transparent, B<0xff> or B<1.0> completely opaque). If the alpha
component is not specified then B<0xff> is assumed.

The string B<random> will result in a random color.

=head2 Channel Layout


A channel layout specifies the spatial disposition of the channels in
a multi-channel audio stream. To specify a channel layout, FFmpeg
makes use of a special syntax.

Individual channels are identified by an id, as given by the table
below:

A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms, separated by
'+' or '|'. Each term can be:

=over 4


=item *

the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. B<mono>,
B<stereo>, B<4.0>, B<quad>, B<5.0>, etc.)


=item *

the name of a single channel (e.g. B<FL>, B<FR>, B<FC>, B<LFE>, etc.)


=item *

a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'c', yielding the default channel
layout for that number of channels (see the function
C<av_get_default_channel_layout>). Note that not all channel counts have a
default layout.


=item *

a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'C', yielding an unknown channel
layout with the specified number of channels. Note that not all channel layout
specification strings support unknown channel layouts.


=item *

a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with "0x" (see the
C<AV_CH_*> macros in F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.

=back


Before libavutil version 53 the trailing character "c" to specify a number of
channels was optional, but now it is required, while a channel layout mask can
also be specified as a decimal number (if and only if not followed by "c" or "C").

See also the function C<av_get_channel_layout> defined in
F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.


=head1 EXPRESSION EVALUATION


When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
formula evaluator, implemented through the F<libavutil/eval.h>
interface.

An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
functions.

Two expressions I<expr1> and I<expr2> can be combined to form
another expression "I<expr1>;I<expr2>".
I<expr1> and I<expr2> are evaluated in turn, and the new
expression evaluates to the value of I<expr2>.

The following binary operators are available: C<+>, C<->,
C<*>, C</>, C<^>.

The following unary operators are available: C<+>, C<->.

The following functions are available:

=over 4


=item B<abs(x)>

equal to I<max>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<bitand(x, y)>


=item B<bitor(x, y)>

Compute bitwise and/or operation on I<x> and I<y>.

The results of the evaluation of I<x> and I<y> are converted to
integers before executing the bitwise operation.

Note that both the conversion to integer and the conversion back to
floating point can lose precision. Beware of unexpected results for
large numbers (usually 2^53 and larger).

Compute Gauss function of I<x>, corresponding to
C<exp(-x*x/2) / sqrt(2*PI)>.


=item B<gcd(x, y)>

Return the greatest common divisor of I<x> and I<y>. If both I<x> and
I<y> are 0 or either or both are less than zero then behavior is undefined.


=item B<gt(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is greater than I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<gte(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is greater than or equal to I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<hypot(x, y)>

This function is similar to the C function with the same name; it returns
"sqrt(I<x>*I<x> + I<y>*I<y>)", the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with sides of length I<x> and I<y>, or the distance of the
point (I<x>, I<y>) from the origin.


=item B<if(x, y)>

Evaluate I<x>, and if the result is non-zero return the result of
the evaluation of I<y>, return 0 otherwise.


=item B<if(x, y, z)>

Evaluate I<x>, and if the result is non-zero return the evaluation
result of I<y>, otherwise the evaluation result of I<z>.


=item B<ifnot(x, y)>

Evaluate I<x>, and if the result is zero return the result of the
evaluation of I<y>, return 0 otherwise.

I<var>, which was previously stored with st(I<var>, I<expr>).
The function returns the loaded value.


=item B<lerp(x, y, z)>

Return linear interpolation between I<x> and I<y> by amount of I<z>.


=item B<log(x)>

Compute natural logarithm of I<x>.


=item B<lt(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is lesser than I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<lte(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is lesser than or equal to I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<max(x, y)>

Return the maximum between I<x> and I<y>.


=item B<min(x, y)>

Return the minimum between I<x> and I<y>.

I<l> is not specified then a default log level is used.
Returns the value of the expression printed.

Prints t with loglevel l


=item B<random(x)>

Return a pseudo random value between 0.0 and 1.0. I<x> is the index of the
internal variable which will be used to save the seed/state.


=item B<root(expr, max)>

Find an input value for which the function represented by I<expr>
with argument I<ld(0)> is 0 in the interval 0..I<max>.

The expression in I<expr> must denote a continuous function or the
result is undefined.

I<ld(0)> is used to represent the function input value, which means
that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times with
various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(0)>. When the expression evaluates to 0 then the
corresponding input value will be returned.


=item B<round(expr)>

Round the value of expression I<expr> to the nearest integer. For example, "round(1.5)" is "2.0".


=item B<sgn(x)>

Compute sign of I<x>.


=item B<sin(x)>

Compute sine of I<x>.


=item B<sinh(x)>

Compute hyperbolic sine of I<x>.


=item B<sqrt(expr)>

=item B<st(var, expr)>

Store the value of the expression I<expr> in an internal
variable. I<var> specifies the number of the variable where to
store the value, and it is a value ranging from 0 to 9. The function
returns the value stored in the internal variable.
Note, Variables are currently not shared between expressions.


=item B<tan(x)>

Compute tangent of I<x>.


=item B<tanh(x)>

Compute hyperbolic tangent of I<x>.


=item B<taylor(expr, x)>


=item B<taylor(expr, x, id)>

Evaluate a Taylor series at I<x>, given an expression representing
the C<ld(id)>-th derivative of a function at 0.

When the series does not converge the result is undefined.

I<ld(id)> is used to represent the derivative order in I<expr>,
which means that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times
with various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(id)>. If I<id> is not specified then 0 is assumed.

Note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0,
C<taylor(expr, x-y)> can be used.


=item B<time(0)>

Return the current (wallclock) time in seconds.


=item B<trunc(expr)>

Round the value of expression I<expr> towards zero to the nearest
integer. For example, "trunc(-1.5)" is "-1.0".


=item B<while(cond, expr)>

Evaluate expression I<expr> while the expression I<cond> is
non-zero, and returns the value of the last I<expr> evaluation, or
NAN if I<cond> was always false.

Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a non-zero
value, note that:

C<*> works like AND

C<+> works like OR

For example the construct:
	
	if (A AND B) then C

is equivalent to:
	
	if(A*B, C)


In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
expressions.

The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
The 'B' postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a
unit prefix or used alone. This allows using for example 'KB', 'MiB',
'G' and 'B' as number postfix.

The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

=head1 CODEC OPTIONS


libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.

Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVCodecContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follow:


=over 4


=item B<b> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio,video>B<)>

Set bitrate in bits/s. Default value is 200K.


=item B<ab> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio>B<)>

Set audio bitrate (in bits/s). Default value is 128K.


=item B<bt> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,video>B<)>

Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode, bitrate
tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from the
target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max
bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on quality.


=item B<flags> I<flags> B<(>I<decoding/encoding,audio,video,subtitles>B<)>

Set generic flags.

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<mv4>

=item B<txt_duration>

Sets the display duration of the decoded teletext pages or subtitles in
milliseconds. Default value is -1 which means infinity or until the next
subtitle event comes.

=item B<txt_transparent>

Force transparent background of the generated teletext bitmaps. Default value
is 0 which means an opaque background.

=item B<txt_opacity>

Sets the opacity (0-255) of the teletext background. If
B<txt_transparent> is not set, it only affects characters between a start
box and an end box, typically subtitles. Default value is 0 if

=head1 AUDIO ENCODERS


A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.



=head2 aac


Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoder.

This encoder is the default AAC encoder, natively implemented into FFmpeg.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<b>

Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode. If this option is unspecified it is set to 128kbps.


=item B<q>

Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the B<ffmpeg> command-line tool. For library interface users, use
B<global_quality>.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency. If unspecified will allow the encoder to dynamically
adjust the cutoff to improve clarity on low bitrates.


=item B<aac_coder>

Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<twoloop>

Two loop searching (TLS) method.

This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.  Will tune
itself based on whether B<aac_is>, B<aac_ms> and B<aac_pns>
are enabled.


=item B<anmr>

Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.

This is an experimental coder which currently produces a lower quality, is more
unstable and is slower than the default twoloop coder but has potential.
Currently has no support for the B<aac_is> or B<aac_pns> options.
Not currently recommended.


=item B<fast>

Constant quantizer method.

Uses a cheaper version of twoloop algorithm that doesn't try to do as many
clever adjustments. Worse with low bitrates (less than 64kbps), but is better
and much faster at higher bitrates.
This is the default choice for a coder


=back



=item B<aac_ms>

Sets mid/side coding mode. The default value of "auto" will automatically use
M/S with bands which will benefit from such coding. Can be forced for all bands
using the value "enable", which is mainly useful for debugging or disabled using
"disable".


=item B<aac_is>

Sets intensity stereo coding tool usage. By default, it's enabled and will
automatically toggle IS for similar pairs of stereo bands if it's beneficial.
Can be disabled for debugging by setting the value to "disable".


=item B<aac_pns>

Uses perceptual noise substitution to replace low entropy high frequency bands
with imperceptible white noise during the decoding process. By default, it's
enabled, but can be disabled for debugging purposes by using "disable".


=item B<aac_tns>

Enables the use of a multitap FIR filter which spans through the high frequency
bands to hide quantization noise during the encoding process and is reverted
by the decoder. As well as decreasing unpleasant artifacts in the high range
this also reduces the entropy in the high bands and allows for more bits to
be used by the mid-low bands. By default it's enabled but can be disabled for
debugging by setting the option to "disable".


=item B<aac_ltp>

Enables the use of the long term prediction extension which increases coding
efficiency in very low bandwidth situations such as encoding of voice or
solo piano music by extending constant harmonic peaks in bands throughout
frames. This option is implied by profile:a aac_low and is incompatible with
aac_pred. Use in conjunction with B<-ar> to decrease the samplerate.


=item B<aac_pred>

Enables the use of a more traditional style of prediction where the spectral
coefficients transmitted are replaced by the difference of the current
coefficients minus the previous "predicted" coefficients. In theory and sometimes
in practice this can improve quality for low to mid bitrate audio.
This option implies the aac_main profile and is incompatible with aac_ltp.


=item B<profile>

Sets the encoding profile, possible values:


=over 4


=item B<aac_low>

The default, AAC "Low-complexity" profile. Is the most compatible and produces
decent quality.


=item B<mpeg2_aac_low>

Equivalent to C<-profile:a aac_low -aac_pns 0>. PNS was introduced with the

=head2 ac3 and ac3_fixed


AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The I<ac3> encoder uses floating-point math, while the I<ac3_fixed>
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The I<ac3_fixed> encoder is not the default codec for
any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly using the option
C<-acodec ac3_fixed> in order to use it.


=head3 AC-3 Metadata


The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

level shift during audio reproduction that sets the average volume of the
dialogue to a preset level. The goal is to match volume level between program
sources. A value of -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to
the source volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers in
the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.

If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values in that group will be
written to the bitstream.  Default values are used for those that are written
but have not been specified.  If the mixing levels are written, the decoder
will use these values instead of the ones specified in the C<center_mixlev>

=item B<-channel_coupling> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3 feature
that increases quality by combining high frequency information from multiple
channels into a single channel. The per-channel high frequency information is
sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.

=head2 libfdk_aac


libfdk-aac AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder wrapper.

The libfdk-aac library is based on the Fraunhofer FDK AAC code from
the Android project.

Requires the presence of the libfdk-aac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libfdk-aac>. The library is also incompatible with GPL,
so if you allow the use of GPL, you should configure with
C<--enable-gpl --enable-nonfree --enable-libfdk-aac>.

This encoder has support for the AAC-HE profiles.

VBR encoding, enabled through the B<vbr> or B<flags
+qscale> options, is experimental and only works with some
combinations of parameters.

Support for encoding 7.1 audio is only available with libfdk-aac 0.1.3 or
higher.

For more information see the fdk-aac project at

Use constrained variable bit rate encoding.

=back



=item B<compression_level (>I<comp>B<)>

Set encoding algorithm complexity. Valid options are integers in
the 0-10 range. 0 gives the fastest encodes but lower quality, while 10
gives the highest quality but slowest encoding. The default is 10.


=item B<frame_duration (>I<framesize>B<)>

Set maximum frame size, or duration of a frame in milliseconds. The
argument must be exactly the following: 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60. Smaller
frame sizes achieve lower latency but less quality at a given bitrate.
Sizes greater than 20ms are only interesting at fairly low bitrates.
The default is 20ms.


=item B<packet_loss (>I<expect-loss>B<)>

Set expected packet loss percentage. The default is 0.


=item B<fec (>I<n/a>B<)>

Enable inband forward error correction. B<packet_loss> must be non-zero
to take advantage - frequency of FEC 'side-data' is proportional to expected packet loss.
Default is disabled.


=item B<application (N.A.)>

Set intended application type. Valid options are listed below:


=over 4


=item B<voip>

Favor improved speech intelligibility.

=item B<audio>

Favor faithfulness to the input (the default).

=item B<lowdelay>

Restrict to only the lowest delay modes.

=back



=item B<cutoff (N.A.)>

Set cutoff bandwidth in Hz. The argument must be exactly one of the
following: 4000, 6000, 8000, 12000, or 20000, corresponding to
narrowband, mediumband, wideband, super wideband, and fullband
respectively. The default is 0 (cutoff disabled).


=item B<mapping_family (>I<mapping_family>B<)>

Set channel mapping family to be used by the encoder. The default value of -1
uses mapping family 0 for mono and stereo inputs, and mapping family 1
otherwise. The default also disables the surround masking and LFE bandwidth
optimzations in libopus, and requires that the input contains 8 channels or
fewer.

Other values include 0 for mono and stereo, 1 for surround sound with masking
and LFE bandwidth optimizations, and 255 for independent streams with an
unspecified channel layout.


=item B<apply_phase_inv (N.A.) (requires libopus E<gt>= 1.2)>

If set to 0, disables the use of phase inversion for intensity stereo,
improving the quality of mono downmixes, but slightly reducing normal stereo
quality. The default is 1 (phase inversion enabled).

=head2 libshine


Shine Fixed-Point MP3 encoder wrapper.

Shine is a fixed-point MP3 encoder. It has a far better performance on
platforms without an FPU, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with LAME and other production-grade encoders quality-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.

This encoder only supports stereo and mono input. This is also CBR-only.

The original project (last updated in early 2007) is at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/projects/libshine-fxp/>E<gt>. We only support the
updated fork by the Savonet/Liquidsoap project at E<lt>B<https://github.com/savonet/shine>E<gt>.

Requires the presence of the libshine headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libshine>.

See also B<libmp3lame>.

Specifies the number of chunks to split frames into, between 1 and 64. This
permits multithreaded decoding of large frames, potentially at the cost of
data-rate. The encoder may modify this value to divide frames evenly.

Default value is I<1>.


=item B<compressor> I<integer>

Specifies the second-stage compressor to use. If set to B<none>,
B<chunks> will be limited to 1, as chunked uncompressed frames offer no

This option allows for compression using compression ratio. The compression ratio for each
level could be specified. The compression ratio of a layer C<l> species the what ratio of
total file size is contained in the first C<l> layers.

Example usage:

=head2 libaom-av1


libaom AV1 encoder wrapper.

Requires the presence of the libaom headers and library during
configuration.  You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libaom>.


=head3 Options


The wrapper supports the following standard libavcodec options:


=over 4



=item B<b>

Set bitrate target in bits/second.  By default this will use
variable-bitrate mode.  If B<maxrate> and B<minrate> are
also set to the same value then it will use constant-bitrate mode,
otherwise if B<crf> is set as well then it will use
constrained-quality mode.


=item B<g keyint_min>

Set key frame placement.  The GOP size sets the maximum distance between
key frames; if zero the output stream will be intra-only.  The minimum
distance is ignored unless it is the same as the GOP size, in which case
key frames will always appear at a fixed interval.  Not set by default,
so without this option the library has completely free choice about
where to place key frames.


=item B<qmin qmax>

Set minimum/maximum quantisation values.  Valid range is from 0 to 63
(warning: this does not match the quantiser values actually used by AV1
- divide by four to map real quantiser values to this range).  Defaults
to min/max (no constraint).


=item B<minrate maxrate bufsize rc_init_occupancy>

Set rate control buffering parameters.  Not used if not set - defaults
to unconstrained variable bitrate.


=item B<threads>

Set the number of threads to use while encoding.  This may require the
B<tiles> or B<row-mt> options to also be set to actually
use the specified number of threads fully. Defaults to the number of
hardware threads supported by the host machine.

Set the encoding profile.  Defaults to using the profile which matches
the bit depth and chroma subsampling of the input.


=back


The wrapper also has some specific options:


=over 4

Enable use of alternate reference frames.  Defaults to the internal
default of the library.


=item B<arnr-max-frames (>I<frames>B<)>

=over 4


=item B<default>

Improve resilience against losses of whole frames.

=back

Not enabled by default.


=item B<crf>

Set the quality/size tradeoff for constant-quality (no bitrate target)
and constrained-quality (with maximum bitrate target) modes. Valid
range is 0 to 63, higher numbers indicating lower quality and smaller
output size.  Only used if set; by default only the bitrate target is
used.


=item B<static-thresh>

Set a change threshold on blocks below which they will be skipped by
the encoder.  Defined in arbitrary units as a nonnegative integer,
defaulting to zero (no blocks are skipped).


=item B<drop-threshold>

Set a threshold for dropping frames when close to rate control bounds.
Defined as a percentage of the target buffer - when the rate control
buffer falls below this percentage, frames will be dropped until it
has refilled above the threshold.  Defaults to zero (no frames are
dropped).


=item B<denoise-noise-level (>I<level>B<)>

Amount of noise to be removed for grain synthesis. Grain synthesis is disabled if
this option is not set or set to 0.


=item B<denoise-block-size (>I<pixels>B<)>

=item B<maxsection-pct (>I<pct>B<)>

Maximum percentage variation of the GOP bitrate from the target bitrate. If maxsection-pct

Range is -1 to 5000. Default is -1 (unset).


=item B<frame-parallel (>I<boolean>B<)>

Enable frame parallel decodability features. Default is true.


=item B<tiles>

Set the number of tiles to encode the input video with, as columns x
rows.  Larger numbers allow greater parallelism in both encoding and
decoding, but may decrease coding efficiency.  Defaults to the minimum
number of tiles required by the size of the input video (this is 1x1
(that is, a single tile) for sizes up to and including 4K).


=item B<tile-columns tile-rows>

Set the number of tiles as log2 of the number of tile rows and columns.
Provided for compatibility with libvpx/VP9.

=head2 libtheora


libtheora Theora encoder wrapper.

Requires the presence of the libtheora headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libtheora>.

For more information about the libtheora project see
E<lt>B<http://www.theora.org/>E<gt>.


=head3 Options


The following global options are mapped to internal libtheora options
which affect the quality and the bitrate of the encoded stream.


=over 4


=item B<b>

Set the video bitrate in bit/s for CBR (Constant Bit Rate) mode.  In
case VBR (Variable Bit Rate) mode is enabled this option is ignored.

B<qscale> flag, and to enable the C<pass1> and C<pass2>
modes.


=item B<g>

Set the GOP size.


=item B<global_quality>

Set the global quality as an integer in lambda units.

Only relevant when VBR mode is enabled with C<flags +qscale>. The
value is converted to QP units by dividing it by C<FF_QP2LAMBDA>,
clipped in the [0 - 10] range, and then multiplied by 6.3 to get a
value in the native libtheora range [0-63]. A higher value corresponds
to a higher quality.


=item B<q>

Enable VBR mode when set to a non-negative value, and set constant
quality value as a double floating point value in QP units.

The value is clipped in the [0-10] range, and then multiplied by 6.3
to get a value in the native libtheora range [0-63].

This option is valid only using the B<ffmpeg> command-line
tool. For library interface users, use B<global_quality>.

=head2 libwebp


libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper

libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.


=head3 Pixel Format


Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<-lossless> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.


=item B<-compression_level> I<integer>

For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the I<method> option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.


=item B<-qscale> I<float>

For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
I<global_quality> and must be multiplied by I<FF_QP2LAMBDA>.


=item B<-preset> I<type>

Configuration preset. This does some automatic settings based on the general
type of the image.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do not use a preset.

=item B<default>

Use the encoder default.

=item B<picture>

=head2 libx264, libx264rgb


x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libx264>.

libx264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and
4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC
entropy coding, interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations
for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

Many libx264 encoder options are mapped to FFmpeg global codec
options, while unique encoder options are provided through private
options. Additionally the B<x264opts> and B<x264-params>
private options allows one to pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted
by the libx264 C<x264_param_parse> function.

The x264 project website is at
E<lt>B<http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html>E<gt>.

The libx264rgb encoder is the same as libx264, except it accepts packed RGB
pixel formats as input instead of YUV.


=head3 Supported Pixel Formats


x264 supports 8- to 10-bit color spaces. The exact bit depth is controlled at
x264's configure time.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libx264 wrapper. The
B<x264>-equivalent options or values are listed in parentheses
for easy migration.

To reduce the duplication of documentation, only the private options

=item B<x264opts (N.A.)>

Set any x264 option, see B<x264 --fullhelp> for a list.

Argument is a list of I<key>=I<value> couples separated by
":". In I<filter> and I<psy-rd> options that use ":" as a separator
themselves, use "," instead. They accept it as well since long ago but this
is kept undocumented for some reason.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i foo.mpg -c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=123:min-keyint=20 -an out.mkv



=item B<a53cc> I<boolean>

Import closed captions (which must be ATSC compatible format) into output.
Only the mpeg2 and h264 decoders provide these. Default is 1 (on).


=item B<x264-params (N.A.)>

Override the x264 configuration using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters.

This option is functionally the same as the B<x264opts>, but is
duplicated for compatibility with the Libav fork.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v libx264 -x264-params level=30:bframes=0:weightp=0:\
	cabac=0:ref=1:vbv-maxrate=768:vbv-bufsize=2000:analyse=all:me=umh:\

This encoder requires the presence of the libxvidcore headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libxvid --enable-gpl>.

How many bits to allot for coding one macroblock. Different profiles use
between 200 and 2400 bits per macroblock, the maximum is 8000.


=item B<mbs_per_slice> I<integer>

Number of macroblocks in each slice (1-8); the default value (8)
should be good in almost all situations.


=item B<vendor> I<string>

Override the 4-byte vendor ID.
A custom vendor ID like I<apl0> would claim the stream was produced by
the Apple encoder.


=item B<alpha_bits> I<integer>

Specify number of bits for alpha component.
Possible values are I<0>, I<8> and I<16>.
Use I<0> to disable alpha plane coding.


=back



=head3 Speed considerations


In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher B<bits_per_mb> limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the B<qscale> parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.


=head2 QSV encoders


The family of Intel QuickSync Video encoders (MPEG-2, H.264, HEVC, JPEG/MJPEG and VP9)

The ratecontrol method is selected as follows:


=over 4


=item *

When B<global_quality> is specified, a quality-based mode is used.
Specifically this means either

=over 4


=item -

I<CQP> - constant quantizer scale, when the B<qscale> codec flag is
also set (the B<-qscale> ffmpeg option).


=item -

I<LA_ICQ> - intelligent constant quality with lookahead, when the
B<look_ahead> option is also set.


=item -

I<ICQ> -- intelligent constant quality otherwise.

=back



=item *

Otherwise, a bitrate-based mode is used. For all of those, you should specify at
least the desired average bitrate with the B<b> option.

=over 4


=item -

I<LA> - VBR with lookahead, when the B<look_ahead> option is specified.


=item -

I<VCM> - video conferencing mode, when the B<vcm> option is set.


=item -

I<CBR> - constant bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified and equal to
the average bitrate.


=item -

I<VBR> - variable bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified, but is higher
than the average bitrate.


=item -

I<AVBR> - average VBR mode, when B<maxrate> is not specified. This mode
is further configured by the B<avbr_accuracy> and
B<avbr_convergence> options.

=back


=back


Note that depending on your system, a different mode than the one you specified
may be selected by the encoder. Set the verbosity level to I<verbose> or
higher to see the actual settings used by the QSV runtime.

Additional libavcodec global options are mapped to MSDK options as follows:

All encoders support the following options:

=over 4


=item B<low_power>

Some drivers/platforms offer a second encoder for some codecs intended to use
less power than the default encoder; setting this option will attempt to use
that encoder.  Note that it may support a reduced feature set, so some other
options may not be available in this mode.


=item B<idr_interval>

Set the number of normal intra frames between full-refresh (IDR) frames in
open-GOP mode.  The intra frames are still IRAPs, but will not include global
headers and may have non-decodable leading pictures.


=item B<b_depth>

Set the B-frame reference depth.  When set to one (the default), all B-frames
will refer only to P- or I-frames.  When set to greater values multiple layers
of B-frames will be present, frames in each layer only referring to frames in
higher layers.


=item B<rc_mode>

Set the rate control mode to use.  A given driver may only support a subset of
modes.

Possible modes:

Some combination of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<hdr>

Include HDR metadata if the input frames have it
(I<mastering_display_colour_volume> and I<content_light_level>
messages).

=back



=item B<tiles>

Set the number of tiles to encode the input video with, as columns x rows.
Larger numbers allow greater parallelism in both encoding and decoding, but
may decrease coding efficiency.


=back



=item B<mjpeg_vaapi>

Only baseline DCT encoding is supported.  The encoder always uses the standard
quantisation and huffman tables - B<global_quality> scales the standard
quantisation table (range 1-100).

For YUV, 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 subsampling modes are supported.  RGB is also
supported, and will create an RGB JPEG.


=over 4


=item B<jfif>

Include JFIF header in each frame (not included by default).

=item B<huffman>

Include standard huffman tables (on by default).  Turning this off will save
a few hundred bytes in each output frame, but may lose compatibility with some
JPEG decoders which don't fully handle MJPEG.

=back



=item B<mpeg2_vaapi>

B<profile> and B<level> set the value of I<profile_and_level_indication>.


=item B<vp8_vaapi>

B-frames are not supported.

B<global_quality> sets the I<q_idx> used for non-key frames (range 0-127).


=over 4


=item B<loop_filter_level>


=item B<loop_filter_sharpness>

Manually set the loop filter parameters.

B<global_quality> sets the I<q_idx> used for P-frames (range 0-255).


=over 4


=item B<loop_filter_level>


=item B<loop_filter_sharpness>

Manually set the loop filter parameters.

=back


B-frames are supported, but the output stream is always in encode order rather than display
order.  If B-frames are enabled, it may be necessary to use the B<vp9_raw_reorder>
bitstream filter to modify the output stream to display frames in the correct order.

Only normal frames are produced - the B<vp9_superframe> bitstream filter may be
required to produce a stream usable with all decoders.


=back



=head2 vc2


SMPTE VC-2 (previously BBC Dirac Pro). This codec was primarily aimed at
professional broadcasting but since it supports yuv420, yuv422 and yuv444 at
8 (limited range or full range), 10 or 12 bits, this makes it suitable for
other tasks which require low overhead and low compression (like screen
recording).


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<b>

Sets target video bitrate. Usually that's around 1:6 of the uncompressed
video bitrate (e.g. for 1920x1080 50fps yuv422p10 that's around 400Mbps). Higher
values (close to the uncompressed bitrate) turn on lossless compression mode.


=item B<field_order>

Enables field coding when set (e.g. to tt - top field first) for interlaced
inputs. Should increase compression with interlaced content as it splits the
fields and encodes each separately.


=item B<wavelet_depth>

Sets the total amount of wavelet transforms to apply, between 1 and 5 (default).
Lower values reduce compression and quality. Less capable decoders may not be
able to handle values of B<wavelet_depth> over 3.


=item B<wavelet_type>

Sets the transform type. Currently only I<5_3> (LeGall) and I<9_7>
(Deslauriers-Dubuc)
are implemented, with 9_7 being the one with better compression and thus
is the default.


=item B<slice_width>


=item B<slice_height>

Sets the slice size for each slice. Larger values result in better compression.
For compatibility with other more limited decoders use B<slice_width> of
32 and B<slice_height> of 8.


=item B<tolerance>

Sets the undershoot tolerance of the rate control system in percent. This is
to prevent an expensive search from being run.


=item B<qm>

Sets the quantization matrix preset to use by default or when B<wavelet_depth>
is set to 5

=over 4


=item -

I<default>
Uses the default quantization matrix from the specifications, extended with
values for the fifth level. This provides a good balance between keeping detail
and omitting artifacts.


=item -

I<flat>
Use a completely zeroed out quantization matrix. This increases PSNR but might
reduce perception. Use in bogus benchmarks.


=item -

I<color>
Reduces detail but attempts to preserve color at extremely low bitrates.

=head1 SUBTITLES ENCODERS

Typically they are stored in VOBSUB file pairs (*.idx + *.sub),
and they can also be used in Matroska files.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<palette>

Specify the global palette used by the bitmaps.

The format for this option is a string containing 16 24-bits hexadecimal
numbers (without 0x prefix) separated by commas, for example C<0d00ee,
ee450d, 101010, eaeaea, 0ce60b, ec14ed, ebff0b, 0d617a, 7b7b7b, d1d1d1,
7b2a0e, 0d950c, 0f007b, cf0dec, cfa80c, 7c127b>.


=item B<even_rows_fix>

When set to 1, enable a work-around that makes the number of pixel rows
even in all subtitles.  This fixes a problem with some players that
cut off the bottom row if the number is odd.  The work-around just adds
a fully transparent row if needed.  The overhead is low, typically
one byte per subtitle on average.

By default, this work-around is disabled.

=back



=head1 BITSTREAM FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported bitstream
filters are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using
the configure option C<--list-bsfs>.

You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure option
C<--disable-bsfs>, and selectively enable any bitstream filter using
the option C<--enable-bsf=BSF>, or you can disable a particular
bitstream filter using the option C<--disable-bsf=BSF>.

The option C<-bsfs> of the ff* tools will display the list of
all the supported bitstream filters included in your build.

The ff* tools have a -bsf option applied per stream, taking a
comma-separated list of filters, whose parameters follow the filter
name after a '='.

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v filter1[=opt1=str1:opt2=str2][,filter2] OUTPUT

Convert MPEG-2/4 AAC ADTS to an MPEG-4 Audio Specific Configuration
bitstream.

This filter creates an MPEG-4 AudioSpecificConfig from an MPEG-2/4
ADTS header and removes the ADTS header.

This filter is required for example when copying an AAC stream from a
raw ADTS AAC or an MPEG-TS container to MP4A-LATM, to an FLV file, or
to MOV/MP4 files and related formats such as 3GP or M4A. Please note
that it is auto-inserted for MP4A-LATM and MOV/MP4 and related formats.


=head2 av1_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an AV1 stream.


=over 4


=item B<td>

Insert or remove temporal delimiter OBUs in all temporal units of the
stream.


=over 4


=item B<insert>

Insert a TD at the beginning of every TU which does not already have one.

=item B<remove>

Remove the TD from the beginning of every TU which has one.

=back



=item B<color_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the color description fields in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2).


=item B<color_range>

Set the color range in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2; note that
this cannot be set for streams using BT.709 primaries, sRGB transfer
characteristic and identity (RGB) matrix coefficients).

=over 4


=item B<tv>

Limited range.

=item B<pc>

Full range.

=back



=item B<chroma_sample_position>

Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2).
This can only be set for 4:2:0 streams.


=over 4


=item B<vertical>

Left position (matching the default in MPEG-2 and H.264).

=item B<colocated>

Top-left position.

=back



=item B<tick_rate>

Set the tick rate (I<num_units_in_display_tick / time_scale>) in
the timing info in the sequence header.

=item B<num_ticks_per_picture>

Set the number of ticks in each picture, to indicate that the stream
has a fixed framerate.  Ignored if B<tick_rate> is not also set.


=item B<delete_padding>

Deletes Padding OBUs.


=back



=head2 chomp


Remove zero padding at the end of a packet.


=head2 dca_core


Extract the core from a DCA/DTS stream, dropping extensions such as
DTS-HD.


=head2 dump_extra


Add extradata to the beginning of the filtered packets except when
said packets already exactly begin with the extradata that is intended
to be added.


=over 4


=item B<freq>

The additional argument specifies which packets should be filtered.
It accepts the values:

=over 4


=item B<k>


=item B<keyframe>

add extradata to all key packets


=item B<e>


=item B<all>

add extradata to all packets

=back


=back


If not specified it is assumed B<k>.

For example the following B<ffmpeg> command forces a global
header (thus disabling individual packet headers) in the H.264 packets
generated by the C<libx264> encoder, but corrects them by adding
the header stored in extradata to the key packets:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -flags:v +global_header -c:v libx264 -bsf:v dump_extra out.ts



=head2 eac3_core


Extract the core from a E-AC-3 stream, dropping extra channels.


=head2 extract_extradata


Extract the in-band extradata.

Certain codecs allow the long-term headers (e.g. MPEG-2 sequence headers,
or H.264/HEVC (VPS/)SPS/PPS) to be transmitted either "in-band" (i.e. as a part
of the bitstream containing the coded frames) or "out of band" (e.g. on the
container level). This latter form is called "extradata" in FFmpeg terminology.

This bitstream filter detects the in-band headers and makes them available as
extradata.


=over 4


=item B<remove>

When this option is enabled, the long-term headers are removed from the
bitstream after extraction.

=back



=head2 filter_units


Remove units with types in or not in a given set from the stream.


=over 4


=item B<pass_types>

List of unit types or ranges of unit types to pass through while removing
all others.  This is specified as a '|'-separated list of unit type values
or ranges of values with '-'.


=item B<remove_types>

Identical to B<pass_types>, except the units in the given set
removed and all others passed through.

=back


Extradata is unchanged by this transformation, but note that if the stream
contains inline parameter sets then the output may be unusable if they are
removed.

For example, to remove all non-VCL NAL units from an H.264 stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v 'filter_units=pass_types=1-5' OUTPUT


To remove all AUDs, SEI and filler from an H.265 stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v 'filter_units=remove_types=35|38-40' OUTPUT



=head2 hapqa_extract


Extract Rgb or Alpha part of an HAPQA file, without recompression, in order to create an HAPQ or an HAPAlphaOnly file.


=over 4

Specifies the texture to keep.


=over 4


=item B<color>


=item B<alpha>


=back



=back


Convert HAPQA to HAPQ
	
	ffmpeg -i hapqa_inputfile.mov -c copy -bsf:v hapqa_extract=texture=color -tag:v HapY -metadata:s:v:0 encoder="HAPQ" hapq_file.mov


Convert HAPQA to HAPAlphaOnly
	
	ffmpeg -i hapqa_inputfile.mov -c copy -bsf:v hapqa_extract=texture=alpha -tag:v HapA -metadata:s:v:0 encoder="HAPAlpha Only" hapalphaonly_file.mov



=head2 h264_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an H.264 stream.

=back



=item B<sample_aspect_ratio>

Set the sample aspect ratio of the stream in the VUI parameters.


=item B<overscan_appropriate_flag>

Set whether the stream is suitable for display using overscan
or not (see H.264 section E.2.1).


=item B<video_format>


=item B<video_full_range_flag>

Set the video format in the stream (see H.264 section E.2.1 and
table E-2).


=item B<colour_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the colour description in the stream (see H.264 section E.2.1
and tables E-3, E-4 and E-5).


=item B<chroma_sample_loc_type>

Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see H.264 section
E.2.1 and figure E-1).


=item B<tick_rate>

Set the tick rate (num_units_in_tick / time_scale) in the VUI
parameters.  This is the smallest time unit representable in the
stream, and in many cases represents the field rate of the stream
(double the frame rate).

=item B<fixed_frame_rate_flag>

Set whether the stream has fixed framerate - typically this indicates
that the framerate is exactly half the tick rate, but the exact
meaning is dependent on interlacing and the picture structure (see
H.264 section E.2.1 and table E-6).


=item B<crop_left>


=item B<crop_right>


=item B<crop_top>


=item B<crop_bottom>

Set the frame cropping offsets in the SPS.  These values will replace
the current ones if the stream is already cropped.

These fields are set in pixels.  Note that some sizes may not be
representable if the chroma is subsampled or the stream is interlaced
(see H.264 section 7.4.2.1.1).


=item B<sei_user_data>

Insert a string as SEI unregistered user data.  The argument must
be of the form I<UUID+string>, where the UUID is as hex digits
possibly separated by hyphens, and the string can be anything.

For example, B<086f3693-b7b3-4f2c-9653-21492feee5b8+hello> will
insert the string ``hello'' associated with the given UUID.


=item B<delete_filler>

Deletes both filler NAL units and filler SEI messages.


=item B<level>

Set the level in the SPS.  Refer to H.264 section A.3 and tables A-1
to A-5.

The argument must be the name of a level (for example, B<4.2>), a
level_idc value (for example, B<42>), or the special name B<auto>
indicating that the filter should attempt to guess the level from the
input stream properties.


=back



=head2 h264_mp4toannexb


Convert an H.264 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.264
specification).

This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
transport stream format (muxer C<mpegts>).

For example to remux an MP4 file containing an H.264 stream to mpegts
format with B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts


Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
C<mpegts>) and raw H.264 (muxer C<h264>) output formats.


=head2 h264_redundant_pps


This applies a specific fixup to some Blu-ray streams which contain
redundant PPSs modifying irrelevant parameters of the stream which
confuse other transformations which require correct extradata.

A new single global PPS is created, and all of the redundant PPSs
within the stream are removed.


=head2 hevc_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an HEVC stream.


=over 4


=item B<aud>

Insert or remove AUD NAL units in all access units of the stream.


=over 4

table E.2).


=item B<colour_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the colour description in the stream (see H.265 section E.3.1
and tables E.3, E.4 and E.5).


=item B<chroma_sample_loc_type>

Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see H.265 section
E.3.1 and figure E.1).


=item B<tick_rate>

Set the tick rate in the VPS and VUI parameters (num_units_in_tick /
time_scale).  Combined with B<num_ticks_poc_diff_one>, this can
set a constant framerate in the stream.  Note that it is likely to be
overridden by container parameters when the stream is in a container.


=item B<num_ticks_poc_diff_one>

Set poc_proportional_to_timing_flag in VPS and VUI and use this value
to set num_ticks_poc_diff_one_minus1 (see H.265 sections 7.4.3.1 and
E.3.1).  Ignored if B<tick_rate> is not also set.


=item B<crop_left>


=item B<crop_right>


=item B<crop_top>


=item B<crop_bottom>

Set the conformance window cropping offsets in the SPS.  These values
will replace the current ones if the stream is already cropped.

These fields are set in pixels.  Note that some sizes may not be
representable if the chroma is subsampled (H.265 section 7.4.3.2.1).


=item B<level>

Set the level in the VPS and SPS.  See H.265 section A.4 and tables
A.6 and A.7.

The argument must be the name of a level (for example, B<5.1>), a
I<general_level_idc> value (for example, B<153> for level 5.1),
or the special name B<auto> indicating that the filter should
attempt to guess the level from the input stream properties.


=back



=head2 hevc_mp4toannexb


Convert an HEVC/H.265 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.265
specification).

This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
transport stream format (muxer C<mpegts>).

For example to remux an MP4 file containing an HEVC stream to mpegts
format with B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v hevc_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts


Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
C<mpegts>) and raw HEVC/H.265 (muxer C<h265> or
C<hevc>) output formats.


=head2 imxdump


Modifies the bitstream to fit in MOV and to be usable by the Final Cut
Pro decoder. This filter only applies to the mpeg2video codec, and is
likely not needed for Final Cut Pro 7 and newer with the appropriate
B<-tag:v>.

For example, to remux 30 MB/sec NTSC IMX to MOV:

	
	ffmpeg -i input.mxf -c copy -bsf:v imxdump -tag:v mx3n output.mov



=head2 mjpeg2jpeg


Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is essentially a
JPEG image. The individual frames can be extracted without loss,
e.g. by

	
	ffmpeg -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg


Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images, because
they lack the DHT segment required for decoding. Quoting from
E<lt>B<http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml>E<gt>:

Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the
MJPG fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed -- and *omitted* --
Huffman table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2,
and it must use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or
progressive. . . . You can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and
decode them with a regular JPEG decoder, but you have to prepend
the DHT segment to them, or else the decoder won't have any idea
how to decompress the data. The exact table necessary is given in
the OpenDML spec."

This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted from an MJPEG
stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and lacking a DHT segment) to
produce fully qualified JPEG images.

	
	ffmpeg -i mjpeg-movie.avi -c:v copy -bsf:v mjpeg2jpeg frame_%d.jpg
	exiftran -i -9 frame*.jpg
	ffmpeg -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v copy rotated.avi



=head2 mjpegadump


Add an MJPEG A header to the bitstream, to enable decoding by
Quicktime.



=head2 mov2textsub

metadata header from each subtitle packet.

See also the B<text2movsub> filter.


=head2 mp3decomp


Decompress non-standard compressed MP3 audio headers.


=head2 mpeg2_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an MPEG-2 stream.


=over 4


=item B<display_aspect_ratio>

Set the display aspect ratio in the stream.

The following fixed values are supported:

=over 4


=item B<4/3>


=item B<16/9>


=item B<221/100>


=back

Any other value will result in square pixels being signalled instead
(see H.262 section 6.3.3 and table 6-3).


=item B<frame_rate>

Set the frame rate in the stream.  This is constructed from a table
of known values combined with a small multiplier and divisor - if
the supplied value is not exactly representable, the nearest
representable value will be used instead (see H.262 section 6.3.3
and table 6-4).


=item B<video_format>

Set the video format in the stream (see H.262 section 6.3.6 and
table 6-6).


=item B<colour_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the colour description in the stream (see H.262 section 6.3.6
and tables 6-7, 6-8 and 6-9).


=back



=head2 mpeg4_unpack_bframes


Unpack DivX-style packed B-frames.

DivX-style packed B-frames are not valid MPEG-4 and were only a
workaround for the broken Video for Windows subsystem.
They use more space, can cause minor AV sync issues, require more
CPU power to decode (unless the player has some decoded picture queue
to compensate the 2,0,2,0 frame per packet style) and cause
trouble if copied into a standard container like mp4 or mpeg-ps/ts,
because MPEG-4 decoders may not be able to decode them, since they are
not valid MPEG-4.

For example to fix an AVI file containing an MPEG-4 stream with
DivX-style packed B-frames using B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.avi -codec copy -bsf:v mpeg4_unpack_bframes OUTPUT.avi



=head2 noise


Damages the contents of packets or simply drops them without damaging the
container. Can be used for fuzzing or testing error resilience/concealment.

Parameters:

=over 4


=item B<amount>

A numeral string, whose value is related to how often output bytes will
be modified. Therefore, values below or equal to 0 are forbidden, and
the lower the more frequent bytes will be modified, with 1 meaning
every byte is modified.

=item B<dropamount>

A numeral string, whose value is related to how often packets will be dropped.
Therefore, values below or equal to 0 are forbidden, and the lower the more
frequent packets will be dropped, with 1 meaning every packet is dropped.

=back


The following example applies the modification to every byte but does not drop
any packets.
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c copy -bsf noise[=1] output.mkv



=head2 null

This bitstream filter passes the packets through unchanged.


=head2 pcm_rechunk


Repacketize PCM audio to a fixed number of samples per packet or a fixed packet
rate per second. This is similar to the B<asetnsamples audio
filter> but works on audio packets instead of audio frames.


=over 4


=item B<nb_out_samples, n>

Set the number of samples per each output audio packet. The number is intended
as the number of samples I<per each channel>. Default value is 1024.


=item B<pad, p>

If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio packet with silence, so that it
will contain the same number of samples (or roughly the same number of samples,
see B<frame_rate>) as the previous ones. Default value is 1.


=item B<frame_rate, r>

This option makes the filter output a fixed number of packets per second instead
of a fixed number of samples per packet. If the audio sample rate is not
divisible by the frame rate then the number of samples will not be constant but
will vary slightly so that each packet will start as close to the frame
boundary as possible. Using this option has precedence over B<nb_out_samples>.

=back


You can generate the well known 1602-1601-1602-1601-1602 pattern of 48kHz audio
for NTSC frame rate using the B<frame_rate> option.

=head1 FORMAT OPTIONS


The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the muxers and demuxers. In addition each muxer or
demuxer may support so-called private options, which are specific for
that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<avioflags> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Possible values:

=over 4

Reduce buffering.

=back



=item B<probesize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set probing size in bytes, i.e. the size of the data to analyze to get
stream information. A higher value will enable detecting more
information in case it is dispersed into the stream, but will increase
latency. Must be an integer not lesser than 32. It is 5000000 by default.


=item B<max_probe_packets> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set the maximum number of buffered packets when probing a codec.
Default is 2500 packets.


=item B<packetsize> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Do not fill in missing values in packet fields that can be exactly calculated.

=item B<noparse>

Disable AVParsers, this needs C<+nofillin> too.

=item B<sortdts>

Try to interleave output packets by DTS. At present, available only for AVIs with an index.

=back


Possible values for output files:

=over 4


=item B<autobsf>

Automatically apply bitstream filters as required by the output format. Enabled by default.

=item B<bitexact>

Only write platform-, build- and time-independent data.
This ensures that file and data checksums are reproducible and match between
platforms. Its primary use is for regression testing.

=item B<flush_packets>

Write out packets immediately.

=item B<latm (>I<deprecated>B<,>I<inert>B<)>


=item B<shortest>

Stop muxing at the end of the shortest stream.

streams before EOF.

=back



=item B<seek2any> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Allow seeking to non-keyframes on demuxer level when supported if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<analyzeduration> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Specify how many microseconds are analyzed to probe the input. A
higher value will enable detecting more accurate information, but will
increase latency. It defaults to 5,000,000 microseconds = 5 seconds.

=item B<aggressive>

Consider things that a sane encoder should not do as an error.

=back



=item B<max_interleave_delta> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set maximum buffering duration for interleaving. The duration is
expressed in microseconds, and defaults to 10000000 (10 seconds).

To ensure all the streams are interleaved correctly, libavformat will
wait until it has at least one packet for each stream before actually
writing any packets to the output file. When some streams are
"sparse" (i.e. there are large gaps between successive packets), this
can result in excessive buffering.

This field specifies the maximum difference between the timestamps of the
first and the last packet in the muxing queue, above which libavformat
will output a packet regardless of whether it has queued a packet for all
the streams.

If set to 0, libavformat will continue buffering packets until it has
a packet for each stream, regardless of the maximum timestamp
difference between the buffered packets.


=item B<use_wallclock_as_timestamps> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Use wallclock as timestamps if set to 1. Default is 0.


=item B<avoid_negative_ts> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>


Possible values:

Shift timestamps so that the first timestamp is 0.

=item B<auto (default)>

Enables shifting when required by the target format.

=item B<disabled>

Disables shifting of timestamp.

=back


When shifting is enabled, all output timestamps are shifted by the
same amount. Audio, video, and subtitles desynching and relative
timestamp differences are preserved compared to how they would have
been without shifting.


=item B<skip_initial_bytes> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set number of bytes to skip before reading header and frames if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<correct_ts_overflow> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Correct single timestamp overflows if set to 1. Default is 1.


=item B<flush_packets> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Flush the underlying I/O stream after each packet. Default is -1 (auto), which
means that the underlying protocol will decide, 1 enables it, and has the
effect of reducing the latency, 0 disables it and may increase IO throughput in
some cases.


=item B<output_ts_offset> I<offset> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the output time offset.

I<offset> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

The offset is added by the muxer to the output timestamps.

Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are
delayed bt the time duration specified in I<offset>. Default value
is C<0> (meaning that no offset is applied).


=item B<format_whitelist> I<list> B<(>I<input>B<)>

"," separated list of allowed demuxers. By default all are allowed.


=item B<dump_separator> I<string> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Separator used to separate the fields printed on the command line about the
Stream parameters.
For example, to separate the fields with newlines and indentation:
	
	ffprobe -dump_separator "
	                          "  -i ~/videos/matrixbench_mpeg2.mpg



=item B<max_streams> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Specifies the maximum number of streams. This can be used to reject files that
would require too many resources due to a large number of streams.


=item B<skip_estimate_duration_from_pts> I<bool> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Skip estimation of input duration when calculated using PTS.
At present, applicable for MPEG-PS and MPEG-TS.


=item B<strict, f_strict> I<integer> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Specify how strictly to follow the standards. C<f_strict> is deprecated and
should be used only via the B<ffmpeg> tool.

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<very>

strictly conform to an older more strict version of the spec or reference software

=item B<strict>

strictly conform to all the things in the spec no matter what consequences

=item B<normal>



=item B<unofficial>

allow unofficial extensions

=item B<experimental>

allow non standardized experimental things, experimental
(unfinished/work in progress/not well tested) decoders and encoders.
Note: experimental decoders can pose a security risk, do not use this for
decoding untrusted input.

=head2 Format stream specifiers


Format stream specifiers allow selection of one or more streams that
match specific properties.

The exact semantics of stream specifiers is defined by the
C<avformat_match_stream_specifier()> function declared in the
F<libavformat/avformat.h> header and documented in the
B<Stream specifiers section in the ffmpeg(1) manual>.


=head1 DEMUXERS


Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg that can read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option C<--list-demuxers>.

You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
C<--disable-demuxers>, and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option C<--enable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>, or disable it
with the option C<--disable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>.

The option C<-demuxers> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers. Use C<-formats> to view a combined list of
enabled demuxers and muxers.

The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.


=head2 aa


Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 (.aa) files.


=head2 apng


Animated Portable Network Graphics demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux APNG files.
All headers, but the PNG signature, up to (but not including) the first
fcTL chunk are transmitted as extradata.
Frames are then split as being all the chunks between two fcTL ones, or
between the last fcTL and IEND chunks.


=over 4


=item B<-ignore_loop> I<bool>

Ignore the loop variable in the file if set.

=item B<-max_fps> I<int>

Maximum framerate in frames per second (0 for no limit).

=item B<-default_fps> I<int>

Default framerate in frames per second when none is specified in the file
(0 meaning as fast as possible).

=back



=head2 asf


Advanced Systems Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux ASF files and MMS network streams.


=over 4


=item B<-no_resync_search> I<bool>

Do not try to resynchronize by looking for a certain optional start code.

=back




=head2 concat


Virtual concatenation script demuxer.

This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packets had been muxed
together.

The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.

All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).

The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
C<duration> directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.


=head3 Syntax


The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
following directive is recognized:


=over 4



=item B<C<file I<path>>>

Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.

All subsequent file-related directives apply to that file.


=item B<C<ffconcat version 1.0>>

Identify the script type and version. It also sets the B<safe> option
to 1 if it was -1.

To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appear exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first
line of the script.


=item B<C<duration I<dur>>>

Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.

If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the
whole concatenated video.


=item B<C<inpoint I<timestamp>>>

In point of the file. When the demuxer opens the file it instantly seeks to the
specified timestamp. Seeking is done so that all streams can be presented
successfully at In point.

This directive works best with intra frame codecs, because for non-intra frame
ones you will usually get extra packets before the actual In point and the
decoded content will most likely contain frames before In point too.

For each file, packets before the file In point will have timestamps less than
the calculated start timestamp of the file (negative in case of the first
file), and the duration of the files (if not specified by the C<duration>
directive) will be reduced based on their specified In point.

Because of potential packets before the specified In point, packet timestamps
may overlap between two concatenated files.


=item B<C<outpoint I<timestamp>>>

Out point of the file. When the demuxer reaches the specified decoding
timestamp in any of the streams, it handles it as an end of file condition and
skips the current and all the remaining packets from all streams.

Out point is exclusive, which means that the demuxer will not output packets
with a decoding timestamp greater or equal to Out point.

This directive works best with intra frame codecs and formats where all streams
are tightly interleaved. For non-intra frame codecs you will usually get
additional packets with presentation timestamp after Out point therefore the
decoded content will most likely contain frames after Out point too. If your
streams are not tightly interleaved you may not get all the packets from all
streams before Out point and you may only will be able to decode the earliest
stream until Out point.

The duration of the files (if not specified by the C<duration>
directive) will be reduced based on their specified Out point.


=item B<C<file_packet_metadata I<key=value>>>

Metadata of the packets of the file. The specified metadata will be set for
each file packet. You can specify this directive multiple times to add multiple
metadata entries.


=item B<C<stream>>

Introduce a stream in the virtual file.
All subsequent stream-related directives apply to the last introduced
stream.
Some streams properties must be set in order to allow identifying the
matching streams in the subfiles.
If no streams are defined in the script, the streams from the first file are
copied.


=item B<C<exact_stream_id I<id>>>

Set the id of the stream.
If this directive is given, the string with the corresponding id in the
subfiles will be used.
This is especially useful for MPEG-PS (VOB) files, where the order of the
streams is not reliable.


=back



=head3 Options


This demuxer accepts the following option:


=over 4



=item B<safe>

If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths. A file path is considered safe if it
does not contain a protocol specification and is relative and all components
only contain characters from the portable character set (letters, digits,
period, underscore and hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a
component.

If set to 0, any file name is accepted.

The default is 1.

-1 is equivalent to 1 if the format was automatically
probed and 0 otherwise.


=item B<auto_convert>

If set to 1, try to perform automatic conversions on packet data to make the
streams concatenable.
The default is 1.

Currently, the only conversion is adding the h264_mp4toannexb bitstream
filter to H.264 streams in MP4 format. This is necessary in particular if
there are resolution changes.


=item B<segment_time_metadata>

If set to 1, every packet will contain the I<lavf.concat.start_time> and the
I<lavf.concat.duration> packet metadata values which are the start_time and
the duration of the respective file segments in the concatenated output
expressed in microseconds. The duration metadata is only set if it is known
based on the concat file.
The default is 0.


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Use absolute filenames and include some comments:
	
	# my first filename
	file /mnt/share/file-1.wav
	# my second filename including whitespace
	file '/mnt/share/file 2.wav'
	# my third filename including whitespace plus single quote
	file '/mnt/share/file 3'\''.wav'



=item *

Allow for input format auto-probing, use safe filenames and set the duration of
the first file:
	
	ffconcat version 1.0
	
	file file-1.wav
	duration 20.0
	
	file subdir/file-2.wav


=back



=head2 dash


Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP demuxer.

This demuxer presents all AVStreams found in the manifest.
By setting the discard flags on AVStreams the caller can decide
which streams to actually receive.
Each stream mirrors the C<id> and C<bandwidth> properties from the
C<E<lt>RepresentationE<gt>> as metadata keys named "id" and "variant_bitrate" respectively.


=head2 flv, live_flv


Adobe Flash Video Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux FLV files and RTMP network streams. In case of live network streams, if you force format, you may use live_flv option instead of flv to survive timestamp discontinuities.

	
	ffmpeg -f flv -i myfile.flv ...
	ffmpeg -f live_flv -i rtmp://<any.server>/anything/key ....




=over 4


=item B<-flv_metadata> I<bool>

Allocate the streams according to the onMetaData array content.


=item B<-flv_ignore_prevtag> I<bool>

Ignore the size of previous tag value.


=item B<-flv_full_metadata> I<bool>

Output all context of the onMetadata.

=back



=head2 gif


Animated GIF demuxer.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<min_delay>

Set the minimum valid delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 2.


=item B<max_gif_delay>

Set the maximum valid delay between frames in hundredth of seconds.
Range is 0 to 65535. Default value is 65535 (nearly eleven minutes),
the maximum value allowed by the specification.


=item B<default_delay>

Set the default delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 10.


=item B<ignore_loop>

GIF files can contain information to loop a certain number of times (or
infinitely). If B<ignore_loop> is set to 1, then the loop setting
from the input will be ignored and looping will not occur. If set to 0,
then looping will occur and will cycle the number of times according to
the GIF. Default value is 1.

=back


For example, with the overlay filter, place an infinitely looping GIF
over another video:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ignore_loop 0 -i input.gif -filter_complex overlay=shortest=1 out.mkv


Note that in the above example the shortest option for overlay filter is
used to end the output video at the length of the shortest input file,
which in this case is F<input.mp4> as the GIF in this example loops
infinitely.


=head2 hls


HLS demuxer

Apple HTTP Live Streaming demuxer.

This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.
The id field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting
the discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay),
the caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.
The total bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is
available in a metadata key named "variant_bitrate".

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<live_start_index>

segment index to start live streams at (negative values are from the end).


=item B<allowed_extensions>

',' separated list of file extensions that hls is allowed to access.


=item B<max_reload>

Maximum number of times a insufficient list is attempted to be reloaded.
Default value is 1000.

Enabled by default.


=item B<http_multiple>

Use multiple HTTP connections for downloading HTTP segments.
Enabled by default for HTTP/1.1 servers.


=item B<http_seekable>

Use HTTP partial requests for downloading HTTP segments.
0 = disable, 1 = enable, -1 = auto, Default is auto.

=back



=head2 image2


Image file demuxer.

This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the
option I<pattern_type>.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.

The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<framerate>

Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.

=item B<loop>

If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

=item B<pattern_type>

Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.

I<pattern_type> accepts one of the following values.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Disable pattern matching, therefore the video will only contain the specified
image. You should use this option if you do not want to create sequences from
multiple images and your filenames may contain special pattern characters.

=item B<sequence>

Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.

A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
"%d0I<N>d" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0-padded and I<N> is the total number of 0-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string "%%".

If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between I<start_number> and
I<start_number>+I<start_number_range>-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.; the pattern "i%%m%%g-%d.jpg" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form F<i%m%g-1.jpg>,
F<i%m%g-2.jpg>, ..., F<i%m%g-10.jpg>, etc.

Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to convert a single image file
F<img.jpeg> you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png



=item B<glob>

Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

The pattern is interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.


=item B<glob_sequence> I<(deprecated, will be removed)>

Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
C<%*?[]{}> that is preceded by an unescaped "%", the pattern is
interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.

All glob special characters C<%*?[]{}> must be prefixed
with "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall use "%%".

For example the pattern C<foo-%*.jpeg> will match all the
filenames prefixed by "foo-" and terminating with ".jpeg", and
C<foo-%?%?%?.jpeg> will match all the filenames prefixed with
"foo-", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with ".jpeg".

This pattern type is deprecated in favor of I<glob> and
I<sequence>.

=back


Default value is I<glob_sequence>.

=item B<pixel_format>

Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not specified the pixel
format is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=item B<start_number>

Set the index of the file matched by the image file pattern to start
to read from. Default value is 0.

=item B<start_number_range>

Set the index interval range to check when looking for the first image
file in the sequence, starting from I<start_number>. Default value
is 5.

=item B<ts_from_file>

If set to 1, will set frame timestamp to modification time of image file. Note
that monotonity of timestamps is not provided: images go in the same order as
without this option. Default value is 0.
If set to 2, will set frame timestamp to the modification time of the image file in
nanosecond precision.

=item B<video_size>

Set the video size of the images to read. If not specified the video
size is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=item B<export_path_metadata>

If set to 1, will add two extra fields to the metadata found in input, making them
also available for other filters (see I<drawtext> filter for examples). Default
value is 0. The extra fields are described below:

=over 4


=item B<lavf.image2dec.source_path>

Corresponds to the full path to the input file being read.

=item B<lavf.image2dec.source_basename>

Corresponds to the name of the file being read.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<enable_drefs>

Enable loading of external tracks, disabled by default.
Enabling this can theoretically leak information in some use cases.


=item B<use_absolute_path>

Allows loading of external tracks via absolute paths, disabled by default.
Enabling this poses a security risk. It should only be enabled if the source
is known to be non-malicious.


=item B<seek_streams_individually>

When seeking, identify the closest point in each stream individually and demux packets in
that stream from identified point. This can lead to a different sequence of packets compared
to demuxing linearly from the beginning. Default is true.


=item B<ignore_editlist>

Ignore any edit list atoms. The demuxer, by default, modifies the stream index to reflect the
timeline described by the edit list. Default is false.


=item B<advanced_editlist>

Modify the stream index to reflect the timeline described by the edit list. C<ignore_editlist>
must be set to false for this option to be effective.
If both C<ignore_editlist> and this option are set to false, then only the
start of the stream index is modified to reflect initial dwell time or starting timestamp
described by the edit list. Default is true.


=item B<ignore_chapters>

Don't parse chapters. This includes GoPro 'HiLight' tags/moments. Note that chapters are
only parsed when input is seekable. Default is false.

streams move to different PIDs. Default value is 0.

=back



=head2 mpjpeg


MJPEG encapsulated in multi-part MIME demuxer.

This demuxer allows reading of MJPEG, where each frame is represented as a part of
multipart/x-mixed-replace stream.

=over 4



=item B<strict_mime_boundary>

Default implementation applies a relaxed standard to multi-part MIME boundary detection,
to prevent regression with numerous existing endpoints not generating a proper MIME
MJPEG stream. Turning this option on by setting it to 1 will result in a stricter check
of the boundary value.

=back



=head2 rawvideo


Raw video demuxer.

This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there is no header
specifying the assumed video parameters, the user must specify them
in order to be able to decode the data correctly.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4



=item B<framerate>

Set input video frame rate. Default value is 25.


=item B<pixel_format>

Set the input video pixel format. Default value is C<yuv420p>.


=item B<video_size>

Set the input video size. This value must be specified explicitly.

=back


For example to read a rawvideo file F<input.raw> with
B<ffplay>, assuming a pixel format of C<rgb24>, a video
size of C<320x240>, and a frame rate of 10 images per second, use
the command:
	
	ffplay -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 320x240 -framerate 10 input.raw



=head2 sbg


SBaGen script demuxer.

This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
E<lt>B<http://uazu.net/sbagen/>E<gt> to generate binaural beats sessions. A SBG
script looks like that:
	
	-SE
	a: 300-2.5/3 440+4.5/0
	b: 300-2.5/0 440+4.5/3
	off: -
	NOW      == a
	+0:07:00 == b
	+0:14:00 == a
	+0:21:00 == b
	+0:30:00    off


A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the I<NOW> reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.


=head2 tedcaptions


JSON captions used for E<lt>B<http://www.ted.com/>E<gt>.

TED does not provide links to the captions, but they can be guessed from the
page. The file F<tools/bookmarklets.html> from the FFmpeg source tree
contains a bookmarklet to expose them.

This demuxer accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<start_time>

Set the start time of the TED talk, in milliseconds. The default is 15000
(15s). It is used to sync the captions with the downloadable videos, because
they include a 15s intro.

=back


Example: convert the captions to a format most players understand:
	
	ffmpeg -i http://www.ted.com/talks/subtitles/id/1/lang/en talk1-en.srt



=head2 vapoursynth


Vapoursynth wrapper.

Due to security concerns, Vapoursynth scripts will not
be autodetected so the input format has to be forced. For ff* CLI tools,
add C<-f vapoursynth> before the input C<-i yourscript.vpy>.

This demuxer accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<max_script_size>

The demuxer buffers the entire script into memory. Adjust this value to set the maximum buffer size,
which in turn, acts as a ceiling for the size of scripts that can be read.
Default is 1 MiB.

=back



=head1 MUXERS


Muxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow writing
multimedia streams to a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported muxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available muxers using the
configure option C<--list-muxers>.

You can disable all the muxers with the configure option
C<--disable-muxers> and selectively enable / disable single muxers
with the options C<--enable-muxer=I<MUXER>> /
C<--disable-muxer=I<MUXER>>.

The option C<-muxers> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled muxers. Use C<-formats> to view a combined list of
enabled demuxers and muxers.

A description of some of the currently available muxers follows.



=head2 aiff


Audio Interchange File Format muxer.


=head3 Options


It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<write_id3v2>

Enable ID3v2 tags writing when set to 1. Default is 0 (disabled).


=item B<id3v2_version>

Select ID3v2 version to write. Currently only version 3 and 4 (aka.
ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4) are supported. The default is version 4.


=back




=head2 asf


Advanced Systems Format muxer.

Note that Windows Media Audio (wma) and Windows Media Video (wmv) use this
muxer too.


=head3 Options


It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<packet_size>

Set the muxer packet size. By tuning this setting you may reduce data
fragmentation or muxer overhead depending on your source. Default value is
3200, minimum is 100, maximum is 64k.


=back




=head2 avi


Audio Video Interleaved muxer.


=head3 Options


It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<reserve_index_space>

Reserve the specified amount of bytes for the OpenDML master index of each
stream within the file header. By default additional master indexes are
embedded within the data packets if there is no space left in the first master
index and are linked together as a chain of indexes. This index structure can
cause problems for some use cases, e.g. third-party software strictly relying
on the OpenDML index specification or when file seeking is slow. Reserving
enough index space in the file header avoids these problems.

The required index space depends on the output file size and should be about 16
bytes per gigabyte. When this option is omitted or set to zero the necessary
index space is guessed.


=item B<write_channel_mask>

Write the channel layout mask into the audio stream header.

This option is enabled by default. Disabling the channel mask can be useful in
specific scenarios, e.g. when merging multiple audio streams into one for
compatibility with software that only supports a single audio stream in AVI
(see B<the "amerge" section in the ffmpeg-filters manual>).


=item B<flipped_raw_rgb>

If set to true, store positive height for raw RGB bitmaps, which indicates
bitmap is stored bottom-up. Note that this option does not flip the bitmap
which has to be done manually beforehand, e.g. by using the vflip filter.
Default is I<false> and indicates bitmap is stored top down.


=back




=head2 chromaprint

=head2 crc


CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC of all the input audio
and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
CRC.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
CRC=0xI<CRC>, where I<CRC> is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to
8 digits containing the CRC for all the decoded input frames.

See also the B<framecrc> muxer.


=head3 Examples


For example to compute the CRC of the input, and store it in the file
F<out.crc>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc out.crc


You can print the CRC to stdout with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc -


You can select the output format of each frame with B<ffmpeg> by
specifying the audio and video codec and format. For example to
compute the CRC of the input audio converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit
and the input video converted to MPEG-2 video, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f crc -

=item B<min_seg_duration> I<microseconds>

This is a deprecated option to set the segment length in microseconds, use I<seg_duration> instead.

=item B<seg_duration> I<duration>

Set the segment length in seconds (fractional value can be set). The value is
treated as average segment duration when I<use_template> is enabled and
I<use_timeline> is disabled and as minimum segment duration for all the other
use cases.

Use persistent HTTP connections. Applicable only for HTTP output.

=item B<hls_playlist> I<hls_playlist>

Generate HLS playlist files as well. The master playlist is generated with the filename I<hls_master_name>.
One media playlist file is generated for each stream with filenames media_0.m3u8, media_1.m3u8, etc.

=item B<hls_master_name> I<file_name>

HLS master playlist name. Default is "master.m3u8".

=item B<streaming> I<streaming>

Enable (1) or disable (0) chunk streaming mode of output. In chunk streaming
mode, each frame will be a moof fragment which forms a chunk.

=item B<adaptation_sets> I<adaptation_sets>

Assign streams to AdaptationSets. Syntax is "id=x,streams=a,b,c id=y,streams=d,e" with x and y being the IDs
of the adaptation sets and a,b,c,d and e are the indices of the mapped streams.

To map all video (or audio) streams to an AdaptationSet, "v" (or "a") can be used as stream identifier instead of IDs.

When no assignment is defined, this defaults to an AdaptationSet for each stream.

Optional syntax is "id=x,seg_duration=x,frag_duration=x,frag_type=type,descriptor=descriptor_string,streams=a,b,c id=y,seg_duration=y,frag_type=type,streams=d,e" and so on,
descriptor is useful to the scheme defined by ISO/IEC 23009-1:2014/Amd.2:2015.
For example, -adaptation_sets "id=0,descriptor=E<lt>SupplementalProperty schemeIdUri=\"urn:mpeg:dash:srd:2014\" value=\"0,0,0,1,1,2,2\"/E<gt>,streams=v".
Please note that descriptor string should be a self-closing xml tag.
seg_duration, frag_duration and frag_type override the global option values for each adaptation set.
For example, -adaptation_sets "id=0,seg_duration=2,frag_duration=1,frag_type=duration,streams=v id=1,seg_duration=2,frag_type=none,streams=a"
type_id marks an adaptation set as containing streams meant to be used for Trick Mode for the referenced adaptation set.
For example, -adaptation_sets "id=0,seg_duration=2,frag_type=none,streams=0 id=1,seg_duration=10,frag_type=none,trick_id=0,streams=1"

=item B<timeout> I<timeout>

Set timeout for socket I/O operations. Applicable only for HTTP output.

=item B<index_correction> I<index_correction>

Enable (1) or Disable (0) segment index correction logic. Applicable only when
I<use_template> is enabled and I<use_timeline> is disabled.

When enabled, the logic monitors the flow of segment indexes. If a streams's
segment index value is not at the expected real time position, then the logic
corrects that index value.

Typically this logic is needed in live streaming use cases. The network bandwidth
fluctuations are common during long run streaming. Each fluctuation can cause
the segment indexes fall behind the expected real time position.

=item B<format_options> I<options_list>

Set container format (mp4/webm) options using a C<:> separated list of
key=value parameters. Values containing C<:> special characters must be

=head2 framecrc


Per-packet CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC for each audio
and video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
CRC.

The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
	
	<stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, 0x<CRC>


I<CRC> is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits containing the
CRC of the packet.


=head3 Examples


For example to compute the CRC of the audio and video frames in
F<INPUT>, converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it
in the file F<out.crc>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc out.crc


To print the information to stdout, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc -


With B<ffmpeg>, you can select the output format to which the
audio and video frames are encoded before computing the CRC for each
packet by specifying the audio and video codec. For example, to
compute the CRC of each decoded input audio frame converted to PCM
unsigned 8-bit and of each decoded input video frame converted to
MPEG-2 video, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f framecrc -


See also the B<crc> muxer.



=head2 framehash


Per-packet hash testing format.

This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash for each audio
and video packet. This can be used for packet-by-packet equality
checks without having to individually do a binary comparison on each.

By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. It uses the
SHA-256 cryptographic hash function by default, but supports several
other algorithms.

The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
	
	<stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, <hash>


I<hash> is a hexadecimal number representing the computed hash
for the packet.


=over 4


=item B<hash> I<algorithm>

Use the cryptographic hash function specified by the string I<algorithm>.
Supported values include C<MD5>, C<murmur3>, C<RIPEMD128>,
C<RIPEMD160>, C<RIPEMD256>, C<RIPEMD320>, C<SHA160>,
C<SHA224>, C<SHA256> (default), C<SHA512/224>, C<SHA512/256>,
C<SHA384>, C<SHA512>, C<CRC32> and C<adler32>.

To print the information to stdout, using the MD5 hash function, use
the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framehash -hash md5 -


See also the B<hash> muxer.



=head2 framemd5


Per-packet MD5 testing format.

This is a variant of the B<framehash> muxer. Unlike that muxer,
it defaults to using the MD5 hash function.


=head3 Examples


To compute the MD5 hash of the audio and video frames in F<INPUT>,
converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file
F<out.md5>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 out.md5


To print the information to stdout, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 -

=item B<loop>

Set the number of times to loop the output. Use C<-1> for no loop, C<0>
for looping indefinitely (default).


=item B<final_delay>

Force the delay (expressed in centiseconds) after the last frame. Each frame
ends with a delay until the next frame. The default is C<-1>, which is a
special value to tell the muxer to re-use the previous delay. In case of a
loop, you might want to customize this value to mark a pause for instance.

For example, to encode a gif looping 10 times, with a 5 seconds delay between
the loops:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -loop 10 -final_delay 500 out.gif


Note 1: if you wish to extract the frames into separate GIF files, you need to
force the B<image2> muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v gif -f image2 "out%d.gif"


Note 2: the GIF format has a very large time base: the delay between two frames
can therefore not be smaller than one centi second.



=head2 hash


Hash testing format.

This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash of all the input
audio and video frames. This can be used for equality checks without
having to do a complete binary comparison.

By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. Timestamps
are ignored. It uses the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function by default,
but supports several other algorithms.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
I<algo>=I<hash>, where I<algo> is a short string representing
the hash function used, and I<hash> is a hexadecimal number
representing the computed hash.


=over 4


=item B<hash> I<algorithm>

Use the cryptographic hash function specified by the string I<algorithm>.
Supported values include C<MD5>, C<murmur3>, C<RIPEMD128>,
C<RIPEMD160>, C<RIPEMD256>, C<RIPEMD320>, C<SHA160>,
C<SHA224>, C<SHA256> (default), C<SHA512/224>, C<SHA512/256>,
C<SHA384>, C<SHA512>, C<CRC32> and C<adler32>.


=back



=head3 Examples


To compute the SHA-256 hash of the input converted to raw audio and
video, and store it in the file F<out.sha256>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f hash out.sha256


To print an MD5 hash to stdout use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f hash -hash md5 -


See also the B<framehash> muxer.



=head2 hls


Apple HTTP Live Streaming muxer that segments MPEG-TS according to
the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) specification.

It creates a playlist file, and one or more segment files. The output filename
specifies the playlist filename.

By default, the muxer creates a file for each segment produced. These files
have the same name as the playlist, followed by a sequential number and a
.ts extension.

Make sure to require a closed GOP when encoding and to set the GOP
size to fit your segment time constraint.

For example, to convert an input file with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.mkv -c:v h264 -flags +cgop -g 30 -hls_time 1 out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<out0.ts>, F<out1.ts>, F<out2.ts>, etc.

See also the B<segment> muxer, which provides a more generic and
flexible implementation of a segmenter, and can be used to perform HLS
segmentation.


=head3 Options


This muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<hls_init_time> I<duration>

Set the initial target segment length. Default value is I<0>.

I<duration> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

Segment will be cut on the next key frame after this time has passed on the first m3u8 list.
After the initial playlist is filled B<ffmpeg> will cut segments
at duration equal to C<hls_time>


=item B<hls_time> I<duration>

Set the target segment length. Default value is 2.

I<duration> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.
Segment will be cut on the next key frame after this time has passed.


=item B<hls_list_size> I<size>

Set the maximum number of playlist entries. If set to 0 the list file
will contain all the segments. Default value is 5.


=item B<hls_delete_threshold> I<size>

Set the number of unreferenced segments to keep on disk before C<hls_flags delete_segments>
deletes them. Increase this to allow continue clients to download segments which
were recently referenced in the playlist. Default value is 1, meaning segments older than
C<hls_list_size+1> will be deleted.


=item B<hls_ts_options> I<options_list>

Set output format options using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters. Values containing C<:> special characters must be
escaped.


=item B<hls_wrap> I<wrap>

This is a deprecated option, you can use C<hls_list_size>
and C<hls_flags delete_segments> instead it

This option is useful to avoid to fill the disk with many segment
files, and limits the maximum number of segment files written to disk
to I<wrap>.



=item B<hls_start_number_source>

Start the playlist sequence number (C<#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE>) according to the specified source.
Unless C<hls_flags single_file> is set, it also specifies source of starting sequence numbers of
segment and subtitle filenames. In any case, if C<hls_flags append_list>
is set and read playlist sequence number is greater than the specified start sequence number,
then that value will be used as start value.

It accepts the following values:


=over 4



=item B<generic (default)>

Set the starting sequence numbers according to I<start_number> option value.


=item B<epoch>

The start number will be the seconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00)


=item B<epoch_us>

The start number will be the microseconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00)


=item B<datetime>

The start number will be based on the current date/time as YYYYmmddHHMMSS. e.g. 20161231235759.


=back



=item B<start_number> I<number>

Start the playlist sequence number (C<#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE>) from the specified I<number>
when I<hls_start_number_source> value is I<generic>. (This is the default case.)
Unless C<hls_flags single_file> is set, it also specifies starting sequence numbers of segment and subtitle filenames.
Default value is 0.


=item B<hls_allow_cache> I<allowcache>

Explicitly set whether the client MAY (1) or MUST NOT (0) cache media segments.


=item B<hls_base_url> I<baseurl>

Append I<baseurl> to every entry in the playlist.
Useful to generate playlists with absolute paths.

Note that the playlist sequence number must be unique for each segment
and it is not to be confused with the segment filename sequence number
which can be cyclic, for example if the B<wrap> option is
specified.


=item B<hls_segment_filename> I<filename>

Set the segment filename. Unless C<hls_flags single_file> is set,
I<filename> is used as a string format with the segment number:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -hls_segment_filename 'file%03d.ts' out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<file000.ts>, F<file001.ts>, F<file002.ts>, etc.

I<filename> may contain full path or relative path specification,
but only the file name part without any path info will be contained in the m3u8 segment list.
Should a relative path be specified, the path of the created segment
files will be relative to the current working directory.
When strftime_mkdir is set, the whole expanded value of I<filename> will be written into the m3u8 segment list.

When C<var_stream_map> is set with two or more variant streams, the
I<filename> pattern must contain the string "%v", this string specifies
the position of variant stream index in the generated segment file names.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.ts -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 256k -b:a:0 64k -b:a:1 32k \
	  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:v -map 0:a -f hls -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0 v:1,a:1" \
	  -hls_segment_filename 'file_%v_%03d.ts' out_%v.m3u8

This example will produce the playlists segment file sets:
F<file_0_000.ts>, F<file_0_001.ts>, F<file_0_002.ts>, etc. and
F<file_1_000.ts>, F<file_1_001.ts>, F<file_1_002.ts>, etc.

The string "%v" may be present in the filename or in the last directory name
containing the file, but only in one of them. (Additionally, %v may appear multiple times in the last
sub-directory or filename.) If the string %v is present in the directory name, then
sub-directories are created after expanding the directory name pattern. This
enables creation of segments corresponding to different variant streams in
subdirectories.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.ts -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 256k -b:a:0 64k -b:a:1 32k \
	  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:v -map 0:a -f hls -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0 v:1,a:1" \
	  -hls_segment_filename 'vs%v/file_%03d.ts' vs%v/out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlists segment file sets:
F<vs0/file_000.ts>, F<vs0/file_001.ts>, F<vs0/file_002.ts>, etc. and
F<vs1/file_000.ts>, F<vs1/file_001.ts>, F<vs1/file_002.ts>, etc.


=item B<use_localtime>

Same as strftime option, will be deprecated.


=item B<strftime>

Use strftime() on I<filename> to expand the segment filename with localtime.
The segment number is also available in this mode, but to use it, you need to specify second_level_segment_index
hls_flag and %%d will be the specifier.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -strftime 1 -hls_segment_filename 'file-%Y%m%d-%s.ts' out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<file-20160215-1455569023.ts>, F<file-20160215-1455569024.ts>, etc.
Note: On some systems/environments, the C<%s> specifier is not available. See
  C<strftime()> documentation.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -strftime 1 -hls_flags second_level_segment_index -hls_segment_filename 'file-%Y%m%d-%%04d.ts' out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<file-20160215-0001.ts>, F<file-20160215-0002.ts>, etc.


=item B<use_localtime_mkdir>

Same as strftime_mkdir option, will be deprecated .


=item B<strftime_mkdir>

Used together with -strftime_mkdir, it will create all subdirectories which
is expanded in I<filename>.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -strftime 1 -strftime_mkdir 1 -hls_segment_filename '%Y%m%d/file-%Y%m%d-%s.ts' out.m3u8

This example will create a directory 201560215 (if it does not exist), and then
produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<20160215/file-20160215-1455569023.ts>, F<20160215/file-20160215-1455569024.ts>, etc.

	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -strftime 1 -strftime_mkdir 1 -hls_segment_filename '%Y/%m/%d/file-%Y%m%d-%s.ts' out.m3u8

This example will create a directory hierarchy 2016/02/15 (if any of them do not exist), and then
produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<2016/02/15/file-20160215-1455569023.ts>, F<2016/02/15/file-20160215-1455569024.ts>, etc.



=item B<hls_key_info_file> I<key_info_file>

Use the information in I<key_info_file> for segment encryption. The first
line of I<key_info_file> specifies the key URI written to the playlist. The
key URL is used to access the encryption key during playback. The second line
specifies the path to the key file used to obtain the key during the encryption
process. The key file is read as a single packed array of 16 octets in binary
format. The optional third line specifies the initialization vector (IV) as a
hexadecimal string to be used instead of the segment sequence number (default)
for encryption. Changes to I<key_info_file> will result in segment
encryption with the new key/IV and an entry in the playlist for the new key
URI/IV if C<hls_flags periodic_rekey> is enabled.

Key info file format:
	
	<key URI>
	<key file path>
	<IV> (optional)


Example key URIs:
	
	http://server/file.key
	/path/to/file.key
	file.key


Example key file paths:
	
	file.key
	/path/to/file.key


Example IV:
	
	0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF


Key info file example:
	
	http://server/file.key
	/path/to/file.key
	0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF


Example shell script:
	
	#!/bin/sh
	BASE_URL=${1:-'.'}
	openssl rand 16 > file.key
	echo $BASE_URL/file.key > file.keyinfo
	echo file.key >> file.keyinfo
	echo $(openssl rand -hex 16) >> file.keyinfo
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -re -i testsrc -c:v h264 -hls_flags delete_segments \
	  -hls_key_info_file file.keyinfo out.m3u8



=item B<-hls_enc> I<enc>

Enable (1) or disable (0) the AES128 encryption.
When enabled every segment generated is encrypted and the encryption key
is saved as I<playlist name>.key.


=item B<-hls_enc_key> I<key>

16-octet key to encrypt the segments, by default it
is randomly generated.


=item B<-hls_enc_key_url> I<keyurl>

If set, I<keyurl> is prepended instead of I<baseurl> to the key filename
in the playlist.


=item B<-hls_enc_iv> I<iv>

16-octet initialization vector for every segment instead
of the autogenerated ones.


=item B<hls_segment_type> I<flags>

Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<mpegts>

Output segment files in MPEG-2 Transport Stream format. This is
compatible with all HLS versions.


=item B<fmp4>

Output segment files in fragmented MP4 format, similar to MPEG-DASH.
fmp4 files may be used in HLS version 7 and above.


=back



=item B<hls_fmp4_init_filename> I<filename>

Set filename to the fragment files header file, default filename is F<init.mp4>.

Use C<-strftime 1> on I<filename> to expand the segment filename with localtime.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut  -hls_segment_type fmp4 -strftime 1 -hls_fmp4_init_filename "%s_init.mp4" out.m3u8

This will produce init like this
F<1602678741_init.mp4>


=item B<hls_fmp4_init_resend>

Resend init file after m3u8 file refresh every time, default is I<0>.

When C<var_stream_map> is set with two or more variant streams, the
I<filename> pattern must contain the string "%v", this string specifies
the position of variant stream index in the generated init file names.
The string "%v" may be present in the filename or in the last directory name
containing the file. If the string is present in the directory name, then
sub-directories are created after expanding the directory name pattern. This
enables creation of init files corresponding to different variant streams in
subdirectories.


=item B<hls_flags> I<flags>

Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<single_file>

If this flag is set, the muxer will store all segments in a single MPEG-TS
file, and will use byte ranges in the playlist. HLS playlists generated with
this way will have the version number 4.
For example:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -hls_flags single_file out.m3u8

Will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and a single segment file,
F<out.ts>.


=item B<delete_segments>

Segment files removed from the playlist are deleted after a period of time
equal to the duration of the segment plus the duration of the playlist.


=item B<append_list>

Append new segments into the end of old segment list,
and remove the C<#EXT-X-ENDLIST> from the old segment list.


=item B<round_durations>

Round the duration info in the playlist file segment info to integer
values, instead of using floating point.


=item B<discont_start>

Add the C<#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY> tag to the playlist, before the
first segment's information.


=item B<omit_endlist>

Do not append the C<EXT-X-ENDLIST> tag at the end of the playlist.


=item B<periodic_rekey>

The file specified by C<hls_key_info_file> will be checked periodically and
detect updates to the encryption info. Be sure to replace this file atomically,
including the file containing the AES encryption key.


=item B<independent_segments>

Add the C<#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS> to playlists that has video segments
and when all the segments of that playlist are guaranteed to start with a Key frame.


=item B<iframes_only>

Add the C<#EXT-X-I-FRAMES-ONLY> to playlists that has video segments
and can play only I-frames in the C<#EXT-X-BYTERANGE> mode.


=item B<split_by_time>

Allow segments to start on frames other than keyframes. This improves
behavior on some players when the time between keyframes is inconsistent,
but may make things worse on others, and can cause some oddities during
seeking. This flag should be used with the C<hls_time> option.


=item B<program_date_time>

Generate C<EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME> tags.


=item B<second_level_segment_index>

Makes it possible to use segment indexes as %%d in hls_segment_filename expression
besides date/time values when strftime is on.
To get fixed width numbers with trailing zeroes, %%0xd format is available where x is the required width.


=item B<second_level_segment_size>

Makes it possible to use segment sizes (counted in bytes) as %%s in hls_segment_filename
expression besides date/time values when strftime is on.
To get fixed width numbers with trailing zeroes, %%0xs format is available where x is the required width.


=item B<second_level_segment_duration>

Makes it possible to use segment duration (calculated  in microseconds) as %%t in hls_segment_filename
expression besides date/time values when strftime is on.
To get fixed width numbers with trailing zeroes, %%0xt format is available where x is the required width.

	
	ffmpeg -i sample.mpeg \
	   -f hls -hls_time 3 -hls_list_size 5 \
	   -hls_flags second_level_segment_index+second_level_segment_size+second_level_segment_duration \
	   -strftime 1 -strftime_mkdir 1 -hls_segment_filename "segment_%Y%m%d%H%M%S_%%04d_%%08s_%%013t.ts" stream.m3u8

This will produce segments like this:
F<segment_20170102194334_0003_00122200_0000003000000.ts>, F<segment_20170102194334_0004_00120072_0000003000000.ts> etc.


=item B<temp_file>

Write segment data to filename.tmp and rename to filename only once the segment is complete. A webserver
serving up segments can be configured to reject requests to *.tmp to prevent access to in-progress segments
before they have been added to the m3u8 playlist. This flag also affects how m3u8 playlist files are created.
If this flag is set, all playlist files will written into temporary file and renamed after they are complete, similarly as segments are handled.
But playlists with C<file> protocol and with type (C<hls_playlist_type>) other than C<vod>
are always written into temporary file regardless of this flag. Master playlist files (C<master_pl_name>), if any, with C<file> protocol,
are always written into temporary file regardless of this flag if C<master_pl_publish_rate> value is other than zero.


=back



=item B<hls_playlist_type event>

Emit C<#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT> in the m3u8 header. Forces
B<hls_list_size> to 0; the playlist can only be appended to.


=item B<hls_playlist_type vod>

Emit C<#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD> in the m3u8 header. Forces
B<hls_list_size> to 0; the playlist must not change.


=item B<method>

Use the given HTTP method to create the hls files.
	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -f hls -method PUT http://example.com/live/out.m3u8

This example will upload all the mpegts segment files to the HTTP
server using the HTTP PUT method, and update the m3u8 files every
C<refresh> times using the same method.
Note that the HTTP server must support the given method for uploading
files.


=item B<http_user_agent>

Override User-Agent field in HTTP header. Applicable only for HTTP output.


=item B<var_stream_map>

Map string which specifies how to group the audio, video and subtitle streams
into different variant streams. The variant stream groups are separated
by space.
Expected string format is like this "a:0,v:0 a:1,v:1 ....". Here a:, v:, s: are
the keys to specify audio, video and subtitle streams respectively.
Allowed values are 0 to 9 (limited just based on practical usage).

When there are two or more variant streams, the output filename pattern must
contain the string "%v", this string specifies the position of variant stream
index in the output media playlist filenames. The string "%v" may be present in
the filename or in the last directory name containing the file. If the string is
present in the directory name, then sub-directories are created after expanding
the directory name pattern. This enables creation of variant streams in
subdirectories.

	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 256k -b:a:0 64k -b:a:1 32k \
	  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:v -map 0:a -f hls -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0 v:1,a:1" \
	  http://example.com/live/out_%v.m3u8

This example creates two hls variant streams. The first variant stream will
contain video stream of bitrate 1000k and audio stream of bitrate 64k and the
second variant stream will contain video stream of bitrate 256k and audio
stream of bitrate 32k. Here, two media playlist with file names out_0.m3u8 and
out_1.m3u8 will be created. If you want something meaningful text instead of indexes
in result names, you may specify names for each or some of the variants
as in the following example.


	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 256k -b:a:0 64k -b:a:1 32k \
	  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:v -map 0:a -f hls -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0,name:my_hd v:1,a:1,name:my_sd" \
	  http://example.com/live/out_%v.m3u8


This example creates two hls variant streams as in the previous one.
But here, the two media playlist with file names out_my_hd.m3u8 and
out_my_sd.m3u8 will be created.

	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 256k -b:a:0 64k \
	  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:v -f hls -var_stream_map "v:0 a:0 v:1" \
	  http://example.com/live/out_%v.m3u8

This example creates three hls variant streams. The first variant stream will
be a video only stream with video bitrate 1000k, the second variant stream will
be an audio only stream with bitrate 64k and the third variant stream will be a
video only stream with bitrate 256k. Here, three media playlist with file names
out_0.m3u8, out_1.m3u8 and out_2.m3u8 will be created.
	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 256k -b:a:0 64k -b:a:1 32k \
	  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:v -map 0:a -f hls -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0 v:1,a:1" \
	  http://example.com/live/vs_%v/out.m3u8

This example creates the variant streams in subdirectories. Here, the first
media playlist is created at F<http://example.com/live/vs_0/out.m3u8> and
the second one at F<http://example.com/live/vs_1/out.m3u8>.
	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:a:0 32k -b:a:1 64k -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 3000k  \

	  -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
	  http://example.com/live/out_%v.m3u8

This example creates two audio only and two video only variant streams. In
addition to the #EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag for each variant stream in the master
playlist, #EXT-X-MEDIA tag is also added for the two audio only variant streams
and they are mapped to the two video only variant streams with audio group names
'aud_low' and 'aud_high'.

By default, a single hls variant containing all the encoded streams is created.

	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:a:0 32k -b:a:1 64k -b:v:0 1000k \
	  -map 0:a -map 0:a -map 0:v -f hls \

	  -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
	  http://example.com/live/out_%v.m3u8

This example creates two audio only and one video only variant streams. In
addition to the #EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag for each variant stream in the master
playlist, #EXT-X-MEDIA tag is also added for the two audio only variant streams
and they are mapped to the one video only variant streams with audio group name
'aud_low', and the audio group have default stat is NO or YES.

By default, a single hls variant containing all the encoded streams is created.

This example creates two audio only and one video only variant streams. In
addition to the #EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag for each variant stream in the master
playlist, #EXT-X-MEDIA tag is also added for the two audio only variant streams
and they are mapped to the one video only variant streams with audio group name
'aud_low', and the audio group have default stat is NO or YES, and one audio
have and language is named ENG, the other audio language is named CHN.

By default, a single hls variant containing all the encoded streams is created.

This example adds C<#EXT-X-MEDIA> tag with C<TYPE=SUBTITLES> in
the master playlist with webvtt subtitle group name 'subtitle'. Please make sure
the input file has one text subtitle stream at least.


=item B<cc_stream_map>

Map string which specifies different closed captions groups and their
attributes. The closed captions stream groups are separated by space.
Expected string format is like this
"ccgroup:E<lt>group nameE<gt>,instreamid:E<lt>INSTREAM-IDE<gt>,language:E<lt>language codeE<gt> ....".
'ccgroup' and 'instreamid' are mandatory attributes. 'language' is an optional
attribute.
The closed captions groups configured using this option are mapped to different
variant streams by providing the same 'ccgroup' name in the
C<var_stream_map> string. If C<var_stream_map> is not set, then the
first available ccgroup in C<cc_stream_map> is mapped to the output variant
stream. The examples for these two use cases are given below.

	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:v 1000k -b:a 64k -a53cc 1 -f hls \
	  -cc_stream_map "ccgroup:cc,instreamid:CC1,language:en" \
	  -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
	  http://example.com/live/out.m3u8

This example adds C<#EXT-X-MEDIA> tag with C<TYPE=CLOSED-CAPTIONS> in
the master playlist with group name 'cc', language 'en' (english) and
INSTREAM-ID 'CC1'. Also, it adds C<CLOSED-CAPTIONS> attribute with group
name 'cc' for the output variant stream.
	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -b:v:0 1000k -b:v:1 256k -b:a:0 64k -b:a:1 32k \

	  -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
	  http://example.com/live/out_%v.m3u8

This example adds two C<#EXT-X-MEDIA> tags with C<TYPE=CLOSED-CAPTIONS> in
the master playlist for the INSTREAM-IDs 'CC1' and 'CC2'. Also, it adds
C<CLOSED-CAPTIONS> attribute with group name 'cc' for the two output variant
streams.


=item B<master_pl_name>

Create HLS master playlist with the given name.

	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -f hls -master_pl_name master.m3u8 http://example.com/live/out.m3u8

This example creates HLS master playlist with name master.m3u8 and it is
published at http://example.com/live/


=item B<master_pl_publish_rate>

Publish master play list repeatedly every after specified number of segment intervals.

	
	ffmpeg -re -i in.ts -f hls -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
	-hls_time 2 -master_pl_publish_rate 30 http://example.com/live/out.m3u8

=head2 image2


Image file muxer.

The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.

The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
produce sequentially numbered series of files.
The pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", this string
specifies the position of the characters representing a numbering in
the filenames. If the form "%0I<N>d" is used, the string
representing the number in each filename is 0-padded to I<N>
digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the pattern with
the string "%%".

If the pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified will contain the number 1, all the following
numbers will be sequential.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the image files to write.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will specify a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.
The pattern "img%%-%d.jpg" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
form F<img%-1.jpg>, F<img%-2.jpg>, ..., F<img%-10.jpg>,
etc.

The image muxer supports the .Y.U.V image file format. This format is
special in that that each image frame consists of three files, for
each of the YUV420P components. To read or write this image file format,
specify the name of the '.Y' file. The muxer will automatically open the
'.U' and '.V' files as required.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<frame_pts>

If set to 1, expand the filename with pts from pkt-E<gt>pts.
Default value is 0.


=item B<start_number>

Start the sequence from the specified number. Default value is 1.


=item B<update>

If set to 1, the filename will always be interpreted as just a
filename, not a pattern, and the corresponding file will be continuously
overwritten with new images. Default value is 0.


=item B<strftime>

If set to 1, expand the filename with date and time information from
C<strftime()>. Default value is 0.


=item B<protocol_opts> I<options_list>

Set protocol options as a :-separated list of key=value parameters. Values
containing the C<:> special character must be escaped.


=back



=head3 Examples


The following example shows how to use B<ffmpeg> for creating a
sequence of files F<img-001.jpeg>, F<img-002.jpeg>, ...,
taking one image every second from the input video:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync cfr -r 1 -f image2 'img-%03d.jpeg'


Note that with B<ffmpeg>, if the format is not specified with the
C<-f> option and the output filename specifies an image file
format, the image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous
command can be written as:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync cfr -r 1 'img-%03d.jpeg'


Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to create a single image file
F<img.jpeg> from the start of the input video you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -f image2 -frames:v 1 img.jpeg


The B<strftime> option allows you to expand the filename with
date and time information. Check the documentation of
the C<strftime()> function for the syntax.

For example to generate image files from the C<strftime()>
"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S" pattern, the following B<ffmpeg> command
can be used:
	
	ffmpeg -f v4l2 -r 1 -i /dev/video0 -f image2 -strftime 1 "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.jpg"


You can set the file name with current frame's PTS:
	
	ffmpeg -f v4l2 -r 1 -i /dev/video0 -copyts -f image2 -frame_pts true %d.jpg"


A more complex example is to publish contents of your desktop directly to a
WebDAV server every second:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 1 -i :0.0 -q:v 6 -update 1 -protocol_opts method=PUT http://example.com/desktop.jpg



=head2 matroska


Matroska container muxer.

This muxer implements the matroska and webm container specs.


=head3 Metadata


The recognized metadata settings in this muxer are:


=over 4


=item B<title>

Set title name provided to a single track. This gets mapped to
the FileDescription element for a stream written as attachment.


=item B<language>

Specify the language of the track in the Matroska languages form.

The language can be either the 3 letters bibliographic ISO-639-2 (ISO
639-2/B) form (like "fre" for French), or a language code mixed with a
country code for specialities in languages (like "fre-ca" for Canadian
French).


=item B<stereo_mode>

Set stereo 3D video layout of two views in a single video track.

The following values are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<mono>

video is not stereo

=item B<left_right>

Both views are arranged side by side, Left-eye view is on the left

=item B<bottom_top>

=head3 Options


This muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<reserve_index_space>

By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska
terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space
to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases
-- e.g.  streaming where seeking is possible but slow -- it is useful to put the
index at the beginning of the file.

If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve a given amount
of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing
finishes. If the reserved space does not suffice, no Cues will be written, the
file will be finalized and writing the trailer will return an error.
A safe size for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.

Note that cues are only written if the output is seekable and this option will
have no effect if it is not.

=item B<default_mode>

This option controls how the FlagDefault of the output tracks will be set.
It influences which tracks players should play by default. The default mode
is B<infer>.

=over 4


=item B<infer>

In this mode, for each type of track (audio, video or subtitle), if there is
a track with disposition default of this type, then the first such track
(i.e. the one with the lowest index) will be marked as default; if no such
track exists, the first track of this type will be marked as default instead
(if existing). This ensures that the default flag is set in a sensible way even
if the input originated from containers that lack the concept of default tracks.

=item B<infer_no_subs>

This mode is the same as infer except that if no subtitle track with
disposition default exists, no subtitle track will be marked as default.

=item B<passthrough>

In this mode the FlagDefault is set if and only if the AV_DISPOSITION_DEFAULT
flag is set in the disposition of the corresponding stream.

=back



=item B<flipped_raw_rgb>

If set to true, store positive height for raw RGB bitmaps, which indicates
bitmap is stored bottom-up. Note that this option does not flip the bitmap
which has to be done manually beforehand, e.g. by using the vflip filter.
Default is I<false> and indicates bitmap is stored top down.


=back




=head2 md5


MD5 testing format.

This is a variant of the B<hash> muxer. Unlike that muxer, it
defaults to using the MD5 hash function.


=head3 Examples


To compute the MD5 hash of the input converted to raw
audio and video, and store it in the file F<out.md5>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 out.md5


You can print the MD5 to stdout with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 -


See also the B<hash> and B<framemd5> muxers.


=head2 mov, mp4, ismv


MOV/MP4/ISMV (Smooth Streaming) muxer.

The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a MOV/MP4
file has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location
(written at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for
better playback by adding I<faststart> to the I<movflags>, or
using the B<qt-faststart> tool). A fragmented
file consists of a number of fragments, where packets and metadata
about these packets are stored together. Writing a fragmented
file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if the
writing is interrupted (while a normal MOV/MP4 is undecodable if
it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
very long files (since writing normal MOV/MP4 files stores info about
every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
is that it is less compatible with other applications.


=head3 Options


Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define
how to cut the file into fragments:


=over 4


=item B<-moov_size> I<bytes>

Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file instead of placing the
moov atom at the end. If the space reserved is insufficient, muxing will fail.

=item B<-movflags frag_keyframe>

Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.

=item B<-frag_duration> I<duration>

Create fragments that are I<duration> microseconds long.

=item B<-frag_size> I<size>

Create fragments that contain up to I<size> bytes of payload data.

=item B<-movflags frag_custom>

Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by
calling C<av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)> to write a fragment with
the packets written so far. (This is only useful with other
applications integrating libavformat, not from B<ffmpeg>.)

=item B<-min_frag_duration> I<duration>

Don't create fragments that are shorter than I<duration> microseconds long.

=back


If more than one condition is specified, fragments are cut when
one of the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
C<-min_frag_duration>, which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
conditions to apply.

Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted
through a few other options:


=over 4


=item B<-movflags empty_moov>

Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
at the start of the file, as a normal MOV/MP4 file, containing only
a short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has
a zero duration.

This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

=item B<-movflags separate_moof>

Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat
pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.

This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

=item B<-movflags skip_sidx>

Skip writing of sidx atom. When bitrate overhead due to sidx atom is high,
this option could be used for cases where sidx atom is not mandatory.
When global_sidx flag is enabled, this option will be ignored.

=item B<-movflags faststart>

Run a second pass moving the index (moov atom) to the beginning of the file.
This operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations such
as fragmented output, thus it is not enabled by default.

=item B<-movflags rtphint>

Add RTP hinting tracks to the output file.

=item B<-movflags disable_chpl>

Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom).  Normally, both Nero chapters
and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option
set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can
cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like
mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.

=item B<-movflags omit_tfhd_offset>

Do not write any absolute base_data_offset in tfhd atoms. This avoids
tying fragments to absolute byte positions in the file/streams.

=item B<-movflags default_base_moof>

Similarly to the omit_tfhd_offset, this flag avoids writing the
absolute base_data_offset field in tfhd atoms, but does so by using
the new default-base-is-moof flag instead. This flag is new from
14496-12:2012. This may make the fragments easier to parse in certain
circumstances (avoiding basing track fragment location calculations
on the implicit end of the previous track fragment).

=item B<-write_tmcd>

Specify C<on> to force writing a timecode track, C<off> to disable it
and C<auto> to write a timecode track only for mov and mp4 output (default).

=item B<-movflags negative_cts_offsets>

Enables utilization of version 1 of the CTTS box, in which the CTS offsets can
be negative. This enables the initial sample to have DTS/CTS of zero, and
reduces the need for edit lists for some cases such as video tracks with
B-frames. Additionally, eases conformance with the DASH-IF interoperability
guidelines.

This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

=item B<-write_prft>

Write producer time reference box (PRFT) with a specified time source for the
NTP field in the PRFT box. Set value as B<wallclock> to specify timesource
as wallclock time and B<pts> to specify timesource as input packets' PTS
values.

Setting value to B<pts> is applicable only for a live encoding use case,
where PTS values are set as as wallclock time at the source. For example, an
encoding use case with decklink capture source where B<video_pts> and
B<audio_pts> are set to B<abs_wallclock>.

=back



=head3 Example


Smooth Streaming content can be pushed in real time to a publishing
point on IIS with this muxer. Example:
	
	ffmpeg -re <<normal input/transcoding options>> -movflags isml+frag_keyframe -f ismv http://server/publishingpoint.isml/Streams(Encoder1)



=head2 mp3


The MP3 muxer writes a raw MP3 stream with the following optional features:

=over 4


=item *

An ID3v2 metadata header at the beginning (enabled by default). Versions 2.3 and
2.4 are supported, the C<id3v2_version> private option controls which one is
used (3 or 4). Setting C<id3v2_version> to 0 disables the ID3v2 header
completely.

The muxer supports writing attached pictures (APIC frames) to the ID3v2 header.
The pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single
packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a
single APIC frame.  The stream metadata tags I<title> and I<comment> map
to APIC I<description> and I<picture type> respectively. See
E<lt>B<http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames>E<gt> for allowed picture types.

Note that the APIC frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will
buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised
to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.


=item *

A Xing/LAME frame right after the ID3v2 header (if present). It is enabled by
default, but will be written only if the output is seekable. The
C<write_xing> private option can be used to disable it.  The frame contains
various information that may be useful to the decoder, like the audio duration
or encoder delay.


=item *

A legacy ID3v1 tag at the end of the file (disabled by default). It may be
enabled with the C<write_id3v1> private option, but as its capabilities are
very limited, its usage is not recommended.

=back


Examples:

Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1 out.mp3


To attach a picture to an mp3 file select both the audio and the picture stream
with C<map>:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -i cover.png -c copy -map 0 -map 1
	-metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (Front)" out.mp3


Write a "clean" MP3 without any extra features:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.wav -write_xing 0 -id3v2_version 0 out.mp3

=head2 mxf, mxf_d10, mxf_opatom


MXF muxer.


=head3 Options


The muxer options are:


=over 4


=item B<store_user_comments> I<bool>

Set if user comments should be stored if available or never.
IRT D-10 does not allow user comments. The default is thus to write them for
mxf and mxf_opatom but not for mxf_d10

=back



=head2 null


Null muxer.

This muxer does not generate any output file, it is mainly useful for
testing or benchmarking purposes.

For example to benchmark decoding with B<ffmpeg> you can use the
command:
	
	ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null out.null


Note that the above command does not read or write the F<out.null>
file, but specifying the output file is required by the B<ffmpeg>
syntax.

Alternatively you can write the command as:
	
	ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null -



=head2 nut



=over 4


=item B<-syncpoints> I<flags>

Change the syncpoint usage in nut:

=over 4


=item I<default> B<use the normal low-overhead seeking aids.>


=item I<none> B<do not use the syncpoints at all, reducing the overhead but making the stream non-seekable;>

    Use of this option is not recommended, as the resulting files are very damage
    sensitive and seeking is not possible. Also in general the overhead from
    syncpoints is negligible. Note, -C<write_index> 0 can be used to disable
    all growing data tables, allowing to mux endless streams with limited memory
    and without these disadvantages.

=item I<timestamped> B<extend the syncpoint with a wallclock field.>


=back

The I<none> and I<timestamped> flags are experimental.

=item B<-write_index> I<bool>

Write index at the end, the default is to write an index.

=back


	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f_strict experimental -syncpoints none - | processor



=head2 ogg


Ogg container muxer.


=over 4


=item B<-page_duration> I<duration>

Preferred page duration, in microseconds. The muxer will attempt to create
pages that are approximately I<duration> microseconds long. This allows the
user to compromise between seek granularity and container overhead. The default
is 1 second. A value of 0 will fill all segments, making pages as large as
possible. A value of 1 will effectively use 1 packet-per-page in most
situations, giving a small seek granularity at the cost of additional container
overhead.

=item B<-serial_offset> I<value>

Serial value from which to set the streams serial number.
Setting it to different and sufficiently large values ensures that the produced
ogg files can be safely chained.


=back




=head2 segment, stream_segment, ssegment


Basic stream segmenter.

This muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of nearly
fixed duration. Output filename pattern can be set in a fashion
similar to B<image2>, or by using a C<strftime> template if
the B<strftime> option is enabled.

C<stream_segment> is a variant of the muxer used to write to
streaming output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers,
and is recommended for outputting e.g. to MPEG transport stream segments.
C<ssegment> is a shorter alias for C<stream_segment>.

Every segment starts with a keyframe of the selected reference stream,
which is set through the B<reference_stream> option.

Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file, you need to
make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting times
expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the new
segment with the key frame found next after the specified start
time.

The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.

Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting
the option I<segment_list>. The list type is specified by the
I<segment_list_type> option. The entry filenames in the segment
list are set by default to the basename of the corresponding segment
files.

See also the B<hls> muxer, which provides a more specific
implementation for HLS segmentation.


=head3 Options


The segment muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<increment_tc> I<1|0>

if set to C<1>, increment timecode between each segment
If this is selected, the input need to have
a timecode in the first video stream. Default value is
C<0>.


=item B<reference_stream> I<specifier>

Set the reference stream, as specified by the string I<specifier>.
If I<specifier> is set to C<auto>, the reference is chosen
automatically. Otherwise it must be a stream specifier (see the ``Stream
specifiers'' chapter in the ffmpeg manual) which specifies the
reference stream. The default value is C<auto>.


=item B<segment_format> I<format>

Override the inner container format, by default it is guessed by the filename
extension.


=item B<segment_format_options> I<options_list>

Set output format options using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters. Values containing the C<:> special character must be
escaped.


=item B<segment_list> I<name>

Generate also a listfile named I<name>. If not specified no
listfile is generated.


=item B<segment_list_flags> I<flags>

Set flags affecting the segment list generation.

It currently supports the following flags:

=over 4


=item B<cache>

Allow caching (only affects M3U8 list files).


=item B<live>

Allow live-friendly file generation.

=back



=item B<segment_list_size> I<size>

Update the list file so that it contains at most I<size>
segments. If 0 the list file will contain all the segments. Default
value is 0.


=item B<segment_list_entry_prefix> I<prefix>

Prepend I<prefix> to each entry. Useful to generate absolute paths.
By default no prefix is applied.


=item B<segment_list_type> I<type>

Select the listing format.

The following values are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<flat>

Generate a flat list for the created segments, one segment per line.


=item B<csv, ext>

Generate a list for the created segments, one segment per line,
each line matching the format (comma-separated values):
	
	<segment_filename>,<segment_start_time>,<segment_end_time>


I<segment_filename> is the name of the output file generated by the
muxer according to the provided pattern. CSV escaping (according to
RFC4180) is applied if required.

I<segment_start_time> and I<segment_end_time> specify
the segment start and end time expressed in seconds.

A list file with the suffix C<".csv"> or C<".ext"> will
auto-select this format.

B<ext> is deprecated in favor or B<csv>.


=item B<ffconcat>

Generate an ffconcat file for the created segments. The resulting file
can be read using the FFmpeg B<concat> demuxer.

A list file with the suffix C<".ffcat"> or C<".ffconcat"> will
auto-select this format.


=item B<m3u8>

Generate an extended M3U8 file, version 3, compliant with
E<lt>B<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming>E<gt>.

A list file with the suffix C<".m3u8"> will auto-select this format.

=back


If not specified the type is guessed from the list file name suffix.


=item B<segment_time> I<time>

Set segment duration to I<time>, the value must be a duration
specification. Default value is "2". See also the
B<segment_times> option.

Note that splitting may not be accurate, unless you force the
reference stream key-frames at the given time. See the introductory
notice and the examples below.


=item B<segment_atclocktime> I<1|0>

If set to "1" split at regular clock time intervals starting from 00:00
o'clock. The I<time> value specified in B<segment_time> is
used for setting the length of the splitting interval.

For example with B<segment_time> set to "900" this makes it possible
to create files at 12:00 o'clock, 12:15, 12:30, etc.

Default value is "0".


=item B<segment_clocktime_offset> I<duration>

Delay the segment splitting times with the specified duration when using
B<segment_atclocktime>.

For example with B<segment_time> set to "900" and
B<segment_clocktime_offset> set to "300" this makes it possible to
create files at 12:05, 12:20, 12:35, etc.

Default value is "0".


=item B<segment_clocktime_wrap_duration> I<duration>

Force the segmenter to only start a new segment if a packet reaches the muxer
within the specified duration after the segmenting clock time. This way you
can make the segmenter more resilient to backward local time jumps, such as
leap seconds or transition to standard time from daylight savings time.

Default is the maximum possible duration which means starting a new segment
regardless of the elapsed time since the last clock time.


=item B<segment_time_delta> I<delta>

Specify the accuracy time when selecting the start time for a
segment, expressed as a duration specification. Default value is "0".

When delta is specified a key-frame will start a new segment if its
PTS satisfies the relation:
	
	PTS >= start_time - time_delta


This option is useful when splitting video content, which is always
split at GOP boundaries, in case a key frame is found just before the
specified split time.

In particular may be used in combination with the F<ffmpeg> option
I<force_key_frames>. The key frame times specified by
I<force_key_frames> may not be set accurately because of rounding
issues, with the consequence that a key frame time may result set just
before the specified time. For constant frame rate videos a value of
1/(2*I<frame_rate>) should address the worst case mismatch between
the specified time and the time set by I<force_key_frames>.


=item B<segment_times> I<times>

Specify a list of split points. I<times> contains a list of comma
separated duration specifications, in increasing order. See also
the B<segment_time> option.


=item B<segment_frames> I<frames>

Specify a list of split video frame numbers. I<frames> contains a
list of comma separated integer numbers, in increasing order.

This option specifies to start a new segment whenever a reference
stream key frame is found and the sequential number (starting from 0)
of the frame is greater or equal to the next value in the list.


=item B<segment_wrap> I<limit>

Wrap around segment index once it reaches I<limit>.


=item B<segment_start_number> I<number>

Set the sequence number of the first segment. Defaults to C<0>.


=item B<strftime> I<1|0>

Use the C<strftime> function to define the name of the new
segments to write. If this is selected, the output segment name must
contain a C<strftime> function template. Default value is
C<0>.


=item B<break_non_keyframes> I<1|0>

If enabled, allow segments to start on frames other than keyframes. This
improves behavior on some players when the time between keyframes is
inconsistent, but may make things worse on others, and can cause some oddities
during seeking. Defaults to C<0>.


=item B<reset_timestamps> I<1|0>

Reset timestamps at the beginning of each segment, so that each segment
will start with near-zero timestamps. It is meant to ease the playback
of the generated segments. May not work with some combinations of
muxers/codecs. It is set to C<0> by default.


=item B<initial_offset> I<offset>

Specify timestamp offset to apply to the output packet timestamps. The
argument must be a time duration specification, and defaults to 0.


=item B<write_empty_segments> I<1|0>

If enabled, write an empty segment if there are no packets during the period a
segment would usually span. Otherwise, the segment will be filled with the next
packet written. Defaults to C<0>.

=back


Make sure to require a closed GOP when encoding and to set the GOP
size to fit your segment time constraint.

=back




=head2 streamhash


Per stream hash testing format.

This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash of all the input frames,
on a per-stream basis. This can be used for equality checks without having
to do a complete binary comparison.

By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. Timestamps
are ignored. It uses the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function by default,
but supports several other algorithms.

The output of the muxer consists of one line per stream of the form:
I<streamindex>,I<streamtype>,I<algo>=I<hash>, where
I<streamindex> is the index of the mapped stream, I<streamtype> is a
single character indicating the type of stream, I<algo> is a short string
representing the hash function used, and I<hash> is a hexadecimal number
representing the computed hash.


=over 4


=item B<hash> I<algorithm>

Use the cryptographic hash function specified by the string I<algorithm>.
Supported values include C<MD5>, C<murmur3>, C<RIPEMD128>,
C<RIPEMD160>, C<RIPEMD256>, C<RIPEMD320>, C<SHA160>,
C<SHA224>, C<SHA256> (default), C<SHA512/224>, C<SHA512/256>,
C<SHA384>, C<SHA512>, C<CRC32> and C<adler32>.

=head3 Examples


To compute the SHA-256 hash of the input converted to raw audio and
video, and store it in the file F<out.sha256>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f streamhash out.sha256


To print an MD5 hash to stdout use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f streamhash -hash md5 -


See also the B<hash> and B<framehash> muxers.



=head2 fifo


The fifo pseudo-muxer allows the separation of encoding and muxing by using
first-in-first-out queue and running the actual muxer in a separate thread. This
is especially useful in combination with the B<tee> muxer and can be used to
send data to several destinations with different reliability/writing speed/latency.

API users should be aware that callback functions (interrupt_callback,
io_open and io_close) used within its AVFormatContext must be thread-safe.

The behavior of the fifo muxer if the queue fills up or if the output fails is
selectable,


=over 4



=item *

output can be transparently restarted with configurable delay between retries
based on real time or time of the processed stream.


=item *

encoding can be blocked during temporary failure, or continue transparently
dropping packets in case fifo queue fills up.


=back



=over 4



=item B<fifo_format>

Specify the format name. Useful if it cannot be guessed from the
output name suffix.


=item B<queue_size>

Specify size of the queue (number of packets). Default value is 60.


=item B<format_opts>

Specify format options for the underlying muxer. Muxer options can be specified
as a list of I<key>=I<value> pairs separated by ':'.


=item B<drop_pkts_on_overflow> I<bool>

If set to 1 (true), in case the fifo queue fills up, packets will be dropped
rather than blocking the encoder. This makes it possible to continue streaming without
delaying the input, at the cost of omitting part of the stream. By default
this option is set to 0 (false), so in such cases the encoder will be blocked
until the muxer processes some of the packets and none of them is lost.


=item B<attempt_recovery> I<bool>

If failure occurs, attempt to recover the output. This is especially useful
when used with network output, since it makes it possible to restart streaming transparently.
By default this option is set to 0 (false).


=item B<max_recovery_attempts>

Sets maximum number of successive unsuccessful recovery attempts after which
the output fails permanently. By default this option is set to 0 (unlimited).


=item B<recovery_wait_time> I<duration>

Waiting time before the next recovery attempt after previous unsuccessful
recovery attempt. Default value is 5 seconds.


=item B<recovery_wait_streamtime> I<bool>

If set to 0 (false), the real time is used when waiting for the recovery
attempt (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least
recovery_wait_time seconds).
If set to 1 (true), the time of the processed stream is taken into account
instead (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least I<recovery_wait_time>
seconds of the stream is omitted).
By default, this option is set to 0 (false).


=item B<recover_any_error> I<bool>

If set to 1 (true), recovery will be attempted regardless of type of the error
causing the failure. By default this option is set to 0 (false) and in case of
certain (usually permanent) errors the recovery is not attempted even when
I<attempt_recovery> is set to 1.


=item B<restart_with_keyframe> I<bool>

Specify whether to wait for the keyframe after recovering from
queue overflow or failure. This option is set to 0 (false) by default.


=item B<timeshift> I<duration>

Buffer the specified amount of packets and delay writing the output. Note that
I<queue_size> must be big enough to store the packets for timeshift. At the
end of the input the fifo buffer is flushed at realtime speed.

=head2 tee


The tee muxer can be used to write the same data to several outputs, such as files or streams.
It can be used, for example, to stream a video over a network and save it to disk at the same time.

It is different from specifying several outputs to the B<ffmpeg>
command-line tool. With the tee muxer, the audio and video data will be encoded only once.
With conventional multiple outputs, multiple encoding operations in parallel are initiated,
which can be a very expensive process. The tee muxer is not useful when using the libavformat API
directly because it is then possible to feed the same packets to several muxers directly.

Since the tee muxer does not represent any particular output format, ffmpeg cannot auto-select
output streams. So all streams intended for output must be specified using C<-map>. See
the examples below.

Some encoders may need different options depending on the output format;
the auto-detection of this can not work with the tee muxer, so they need to be explicitly specified.
The main example is the B<global_header> flag.

The slave outputs are specified in the file name given to the muxer,
separated by '|'. If any of the slave name contains the '|' separator,
leading or trailing spaces or any special character, those must be
escaped (see B<the "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>).


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<use_fifo> I<bool>

If set to 1, slave outputs will be processed in separate threads using the B<fifo>
muxer. This allows to compensate for different speed/latency/reliability of
outputs and setup transparent recovery. By default this feature is turned off.


=item B<fifo_options>

Options to pass to fifo pseudo-muxer instances. See B<fifo>.


=back


Muxer options can be specified for each slave by prepending them as a list of
I<key>=I<value> pairs separated by ':', between square brackets. If
the options values contain a special character or the ':' separator, they
must be escaped; note that this is a second level escaping.

The following special options are also recognized:

=over 4


=item B<f>

Specify the format name. Required if it cannot be guessed from the
output URL.


=item B<bsfs[/>I<spec>B<]>

Specify a list of bitstream filters to apply to the specified
output.

It is possible to specify to which streams a given bitstream filter
applies, by appending a stream specifier to the option separated by
C</>. I<spec> must be a stream specifier (see B<Format
stream specifiers>).

If the stream specifier is not specified, the bitstream filters will be
applied to all streams in the output. This will cause that output operation
to fail if the output contains streams to which the bitstream filter cannot
be applied e.g. C<h264_mp4toannexb> being applied to an output containing an audio stream.

Options for a bitstream filter must be specified in the form of C<opt=value>.

Several bitstream filters can be specified, separated by ",".


=item B<use_fifo> I<bool>

This allows to override tee muxer use_fifo option for individual slave muxer.


=item B<fifo_options>

This allows to override tee muxer fifo_options for individual slave muxer.
See B<fifo>.


=item B<select>

Select the streams that should be mapped to the slave output,
specified by a stream specifier. If not specified, this defaults to
all the mapped streams. This will cause that output operation to fail
if the output format does not accept all mapped streams.

You may use multiple stream specifiers separated by commas (C<,>) e.g.: C<a:0,v>


=item B<onfail>

Specify behaviour on output failure. This can be set to either C<abort> (which is
default) or C<ignore>. C<abort> will cause whole process to fail in case of failure
on this slave output. C<ignore> will ignore failure on this output, so other outputs
will continue without being affected.

=head1 METADATA


FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF-8-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.

The file format is as follows:

=over 4



=item 1.

A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.


=item 2.

The header is a B<;FFMETADATA> string, followed by a version number (now 1).


=item 3.

Metadata tags are of the form B<key=value>


=item 4.

Immediately after header follows global metadata


=item 5.

After global metadata there may be sections with per-stream/per-chapter
metadata.


=item 6.

A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. STREAM or CHAPTER) in
brackets (B<[>, B<]>) and ends with next section or end of file.


=item 7.

At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form
B<TIMEBASE=>I<num>B</>I<den>, where I<num> and I<den> are
integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in nanoseconds.

Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
B<START=>I<num>, B<END=>I<num>, where I<num> is a positive
integer.


=item 8.

Empty lines and lines starting with B<;> or B<#> are ignored.


=item 9.

Metadata keys or values containing special characters (B<=>, B<;>,
B<#>, B<\> and a newline) must be escaped with a backslash B<\>.


=item 10.

Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. B<foo = bar>) is considered to be
a part of the tag (in the example above key is B<foo> , value is
 B<bar>).

=back


A ffmetadata file might look like this:
	
	;FFMETADATA1
	title=bike\\shed
	;this is a comment
	artist=FFmpeg troll team
	
	[CHAPTER]
	TIMEBASE=1/1000
	START=0
	#chapter ends at 0:01:00
	END=60000
	title=chapter \#1
	[STREAM]
	title=multi\
	line


By using the ffmetadata muxer and demuxer it is possible to extract
metadata from an input file to an ffmetadata file, and then transcode
the file into an output file with the edited ffmetadata file.

Extracting an ffmetadata file with F<ffmpeg> goes as follows:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f ffmetadata FFMETADATAFILE


Reinserting edited metadata information from the FFMETADATAFILE file can
be done as:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -i FFMETADATAFILE -map_metadata 1 -codec copy OUTPUT



=head1 PROTOCOL OPTIONS


The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the protocols. In addition each protocol may support
so-called private options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<protocol_whitelist> I<list> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set a ","-separated list of allowed protocols. "ALL" matches all protocols. Protocols
prefixed by "-" are disabled.
All protocols are allowed by default but protocols used by an another
protocol (nested protocols) are restricted to a per protocol subset.

=back




=head1 PROTOCOLS


Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg that enable access to
resources that require specific protocols.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-protocols".

You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
"--disable-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using the
option "--enable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>", or you can disable a
particular protocol using the option
"--disable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>".

The option "-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported protocols.

All protocols accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<rw_timeout>

Maximum time to wait for (network) read/write operations to complete,
in microseconds.

=back


A description of the currently available protocols follows.


=head2 amqp


Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) version 0-9-1 is a broker based
publish-subscribe communication protocol.

FFmpeg must be compiled with --enable-librabbitmq to support AMQP. A separate
AMQP broker must also be run. An example open-source AMQP broker is RabbitMQ.

After starting the broker, an FFmpeg client may stream data to the broker using
the command:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]


Where hostname and port (default is 5672) is the address of the broker. The
client may also set a user/password for authentication. The default for both
fields is "guest". Name of virtual host on broker can be set with vhost. The
default value is "/".

Muliple subscribers may stream from the broker using the command:
	
	ffplay amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]


In RabbitMQ all data published to the broker flows through a specific exchange,
and each subscribing client has an assigned queue/buffer. When a packet arrives
at an exchange, it may be copied to a client's queue depending on the exchange
and routing_key fields.

The following options are supported:


=over 4



=item B<exchange>

Sets the exchange to use on the broker. RabbitMQ has several predefined
exchanges: "amq.direct" is the default exchange, where the publisher and
subscriber must have a matching routing_key; "amq.fanout" is the same as a
broadcast operation (i.e. the data is forwarded to all queues on the fanout
exchange independent of the routing_key); and "amq.topic" is similar to
"amq.direct", but allows for more complex pattern matching (refer to the RabbitMQ
documentation).


=item B<routing_key>

Sets the routing key. The default value is "amqp". The routing key is used on
the "amq.direct" and "amq.topic" exchanges to decide whether packets are written
to the queue of a subscriber.


=item B<pkt_size>

Maximum size of each packet sent/received to the broker. Default is 131072.
Minimum is 4096 and max is any large value (representable by an int). When
receiving packets, this sets an internal buffer size in FFmpeg. It should be
equal to or greater than the size of the published packets to the broker. Otherwise
the received message may be truncated causing decoding errors.


=item B<connection_timeout>

The timeout in seconds during the initial connection to the broker. The
default value is rw_timeout, or 5 seconds if rw_timeout is not set.


=item B<delivery_mode> I<mode>

Sets the delivery mode of each message sent to broker.
The following values are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<persistent>

Delivery mode set to "persistent" (2). This is the default value.
Messages may be written to the broker's disk depending on its setup.


=item B<non-persistent>

Delivery mode set to "non-persistent" (1).
Messages will stay in broker's memory unless the broker is under memory
pressure.


=back



=back



=head2 async


Asynchronous data filling wrapper for input stream.

Fill data in a background thread, to decouple I/O operation from demux thread.

	
	async:<URL>
	async:http://host/resource
	async:cache:http://host/resource



=head2 bluray


Read BluRay playlist.

The accepted options are:

=over 4



=item B<angle>

BluRay angle


=item B<chapter>

Start chapter (1...N)


=item B<playlist>

Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)


=back


Examples:

Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:
	
	bluray:/mnt/bluray


Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start from chapter 2:
	
	-playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray



=head2 cache


Caching wrapper for input stream.

Cache the input stream to temporary file. It brings seeking capability to live streams.

The accepted options are:

=over 4



=item B<read_ahead_limit>

Amount in bytes that may be read ahead when seeking isn't supported. Range is -1 to INT_MAX.
-1 for unlimited. Default is 65536.


=back


URL Syntax is
	
	cache:<URL>



=head2 concat


Physical concatenation protocol.

Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were
a unique resource.

A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
	
	concat:<URL1>|<URL2>|...|<URLN>


where I<URL1>, I<URL2>, ..., I<URLN> are the urls of the
resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct
protocol.

For example to read a sequence of files F<split1.mpeg>,
F<split2.mpeg>, F<split3.mpeg> with B<ffplay> use the
command:
	
	ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg


Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for
many shells.


=head2 crypto


AES-encrypted stream reading protocol.

The accepted options are:

=over 4


=item B<key>

Set the AES decryption key binary block from given hexadecimal representation.


=item B<iv>

Set the AES decryption initialization vector binary block from given hexadecimal representation.

=back


Accepted URL formats:
	
	crypto:<URL>
	crypto+<URL>



=head2 data


Data in-line in the URI. See E<lt>B<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme>E<gt>.

For example, to convert a GIF file given inline with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhCAAIAMIEAAAAAAAA//8AAP//AP///////////////ywAAAAACAAIAAADF0gEDLojDgdGiJdJqUX02iB4E8Q9jUMkADs=" smiley.png



=head2 file


File access protocol.

Read from or write to a file.

A file URL can have the form:
	
	file:<filename>


where I<filename> is the path of the file to read.

An URL that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed to be a
file URL. Depending on the build, an URL that looks like a Windows
path with the drive letter at the beginning will also be assumed to be
a file URL (usually not the case in builds for unix-like systems).

For example to read from a file F<input.mpeg> with B<ffmpeg>
use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<truncate>

Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of 0 prevents
truncating. Default value is 1.


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable for files on slow medium.


=item B<follow>

If set to 1, the protocol will retry reading at the end of the file, allowing
reading files that still are being written. In order for this to terminate,
you either need to use the rw_timeout option, or use the interrupt callback
(for API users).


=item B<seekable>

Controls if seekability is advertised on the file. 0 means non-seekable, -1
means auto (seekable for normal files, non-seekable for named pipes).

Many demuxers handle seekable and non-seekable resources differently,
overriding this might speed up opening certain files at the cost of losing some
features (e.g. accurate seeking).

=back



=head2 ftp


FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

Read from or write to remote resources using FTP protocol.

Following syntax is required.
	
	ftp://[user[:password]@]server[:port]/path/to/remote/resource.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<timeout>

Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to -1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.


=item B<ftp-user>

Set a user to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by the
user in the FTP URL.


=item B<ftp-password>

Set a password to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by
the password in the FTP URL, or by B<ftp-anonymous-password> if no user is set.


=item B<ftp-anonymous-password>

Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an e-mail address
should be used.


=item B<ftp-write-seekable>

Control seekability of connection during encoding. If set to 1 the
resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not
to be seekable. Default value is 0.

=back


NOTE: Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended to not do
it, unless special care is taken (tests, customized server configuration
etc.). Different FTP servers behave in different way during seek
operation. ff* tools may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.


=head2 gopher


Gopher protocol.


=head2 gophers


Gophers protocol.

The Gopher protocol with TLS encapsulation.


=head2 hls


Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as
a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be
remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using the standard
file protocol.
The nested protocol is declared by specifying
"+I<proto>" after the hls URI scheme name, where I<proto>
is either "file" or "http".

	
	hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
	hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8


Using this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work
just as well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.
To use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the
m3u8 files.


=head2 http


HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<seekable>

Control seekability of connection. If set to 1 the resource is
supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not to be seekable,
if set to -1 it will try to autodetect if it is seekable. Default
value is -1.


=item B<chunked_post>

If set to 1 use chunked Transfer-Encoding for posts, default is 1.


=item B<content_type>

Set a specific content type for the POST messages or for listen mode.


=item B<http_proxy>

set HTTP proxy to tunnel through e.g. http://example.com:1234


=item B<headers>

Set custom HTTP headers, can override built in default headers. The
value must be a string encoding the headers.


=item B<multiple_requests>

Use persistent connections if set to 1, default is 0.


=item B<post_data>

Set custom HTTP post data.


=item B<referer>

Set the Referer header. Include 'Referer: URL' header in HTTP request.


=item B<user_agent>

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the protocol will use a
string describing the libavformat build. ("Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>")


=item B<user-agent>

This is a deprecated option, you can use user_agent instead it.


=item B<reconnect_at_eof>

If set then eof is treated like an error and causes reconnection, this is useful
for live / endless streams.


=item B<reconnect_streamed>

If set then even streamed/non seekable streams will be reconnected on errors.


=item B<reconnect_on_network_error>

Reconnect automatically in case of TCP/TLS errors during connect.


=item B<reconnect_on_http_error>

A comma separated list of HTTP status codes to reconnect on. The list can
include specific status codes (e.g. '503') or the strings '4xx' / '5xx'.


=item B<reconnect_delay_max>

Sets the maximum delay in seconds after which to give up reconnecting


=item B<mime_type>

Export the MIME type.


=item B<http_version>

Exports the HTTP response version number. Usually "1.0" or "1.1".


=item B<icy>

If set to 1 request ICY (SHOUTcast) metadata from the server. If the server
supports this, the metadata has to be retrieved by the application by reading
the B<icy_metadata_headers> and B<icy_metadata_packet> options.
The default is 1.


=item B<icy_metadata_headers>

If the server supports ICY metadata, this contains the ICY-specific HTTP reply
headers, separated by newline characters.


=item B<icy_metadata_packet>

If the server supports ICY metadata, and B<icy> was set to 1, this
contains the last non-empty metadata packet sent by the server. It should be
polled in regular intervals by applications interested in mid-stream metadata
updates.


=item B<cookies>

Set the cookies to be sent in future requests. The format of each cookie is the
same as the value of a Set-Cookie HTTP response field. Multiple cookies can be
delimited by a newline character.


=item B<offset>

Set initial byte offset.


=item B<end_offset>

Try to limit the request to bytes preceding this offset.


=item B<method>

When used as a client option it sets the HTTP method for the request.

When used as a server option it sets the HTTP method that is going to be
expected from the client(s).
If the expected and the received HTTP method do not match the client will
be given a Bad Request response.
When unset the HTTP method is not checked for now. This will be replaced by
autodetection in the future.


=item B<listen>

If set to 1 enables experimental HTTP server. This can be used to send data when
used as an output option, or read data from a client with HTTP POST when used as
an input option.
If set to 2 enables experimental multi-client HTTP server. This is not yet implemented
in ffmpeg.c and thus must not be used as a command line option.
	
	# Server side (sending):
	ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -c copy -listen 1 -f ogg http://<server>:<port>
	
	# Client side (receiving):
	ffmpeg -i http://<server>:<port> -c copy somefile.ogg
	
	# Client can also be done with wget:
	wget http://<server>:<port> -O somefile.ogg
	
	# Server side (receiving):
	ffmpeg -listen 1 -i http://<server>:<port> -c copy somefile.ogg
	
	# Client side (sending):
	ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -chunked_post 0 -c copy -f ogg http://<server>:<port>
	
	# Client can also be done with wget:
	wget --post-file=somefile.ogg http://<server>:<port>



=item B<send_expect_100>

Send an Expect: 100-continue header for POST. If set to 1 it will send, if set
to 0 it won't, if set to -1 it will try to send if it is applicable. Default
value is -1.


=item B<auth_type>


Set HTTP authentication type. No option for Digest, since this method requires
getting nonce parameters from the server first and can't be used straight away like
Basic.


=over 4


=item B<none>

Choose the HTTP authentication type automatically. This is the default.

=item B<basic>


Choose the HTTP basic authentication.

Basic authentication sends a Base64-encoded string that contains a user name and password
for the client. Base64 is not a form of encryption and should be considered the same as
sending the user name and password in clear text (Base64 is a reversible encoding).
If a resource needs to be protected, strongly consider using an authentication scheme
other than basic authentication. HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication.
Without these additional security enhancements, basic authentication should not be used
to protect sensitive or valuable information.

=back



=back



=head3 HTTP Cookies


Some HTTP requests will be denied unless cookie values are passed in with the
request. The B<cookies> option allows these cookies to be specified. At
the very least, each cookie must specify a value along with a path and domain.
HTTP requests that match both the domain and path will automatically include the
cookie value in the HTTP Cookie header field. Multiple cookies can be delimited
by a newline.

The required syntax to play a stream specifying a cookie is:
	
	ffplay -cookies "nlqptid=nltid=tsn; path=/; domain=somedomain.com;" http://somedomain.com/somestream.m3u8



=head2 Icecast


Icecast protocol (stream to Icecast servers)

This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<ice_genre>

Set the stream genre.


=item B<ice_name>

Set the stream name.


=item B<ice_description>

Set the stream description.


=item B<ice_url>

Set the stream website URL.


=item B<ice_public>

Set if the stream should be public.
The default is 0 (not public).


=item B<user_agent>

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified a string of the form
"Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>" will be used.


=item B<password>

Set the Icecast mountpoint password.


=item B<content_type>

Set the stream content type. This must be set if it is different from
audio/mpeg.


=item B<legacy_icecast>

This enables support for Icecast versions E<lt> 2.4.0, that do not support the
HTTP PUT method but the SOURCE method.


=item B<tls>

Establish a TLS (HTTPS) connection to Icecast.


=back


	
	icecast://[<username>[:<password>]@]<server>:<port>/<mountpoint>



=head2 mmst


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.


=head2 mmsh


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

The required syntax is:
	
	mmsh://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>]



=head2 md5


MD5 output protocol.

Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes
this to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can
be used to test muxers without writing an actual file.

Some examples follow.
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:


Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.


=head2 pipe


UNIX pipe access protocol.

Read and write from UNIX pipes.

The accepted syntax is:
	
	pipe:[<number>]


I<number> is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the
pipe (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If I<number>
is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used
for writing, stdin for reading.

For example to read from stdin with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
	# ...this is the same as...
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:


For writing to stdout with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat > test.avi
	# ...this is the same as...
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.

=back


Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.


=head2 prompeg


Pro-MPEG Code of Practice #3 Release 2 FEC protocol.

The Pro-MPEG CoP#3 FEC is a 2D parity-check forward error correction mechanism
for MPEG-2 Transport Streams sent over RTP.

This protocol must be used in conjunction with the C<rtp_mpegts> muxer and
the C<rtp> protocol.

The required syntax is:
	
	-f rtp_mpegts -fec prompeg=<option>=<val>... rtp://<hostname>:<port>


The destination UDP ports are C<port + 2> for the column FEC stream
and C<port + 4> for the row FEC stream.

This protocol accepts the following options:

=over 4



=item B<l=>I<n>

The number of columns (4-20, LxD E<lt>= 100)


=item B<d=>I<n>

The number of rows (4-20, LxD E<lt>= 100)


=back


Example usage:

	
	-f rtp_mpegts -fec prompeg=l=8:d=4 rtp://<hostname>:<port>

seconds.


=item B<pkt_size>

Set maximum packet size for sending data. 1316 by default.


=item B<log_level>

Set loglevel for RIST logging messages. You only need to set this if you
explicitly want to enable debug level messages or packet loss simulation,
otherwise the regular loglevel is respected.


=item B<secret>

Set override of encryption secret, by default is unset.


=item B<encryption>

Set encryption type, by default is disabled.
Acceptable values are 128 and 256.

=head2 rtmp


Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for streaming multimedia
content across a TCP/IP network.

The required syntax is:
	
	rtmp://[<username>:<password>@]<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<instance>][/<playpath>]


The accepted parameters are:

=over 4



=item B<username>

An optional username (mostly for publishing).


=item B<password>

An optional password (mostly for publishing).


=item B<server>

The address of the RTMP server.


=item B<port>

The number of the TCP port to use (by default is 1935).


=item B<app>

It is the name of the application to access. It usually corresponds to
the path where the application is installed on the RTMP server
(e.g. F</ondemand/>, F</flash/live/>, etc.). You can override
the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_app> option, too.


=item B<playpath>

It is the path or name of the resource to play with reference to the
application specified in I<app>, may be prefixed by "mp4:". You
can override the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_playpath>
option, too.


=item B<listen>

Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.


=item B<timeout>

Maximum time to wait for the incoming connection. Implies listen.

=back


Additionally, the following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):

=over 4



=item B<rtmp_app>

Name of application to connect on the RTMP server. This option
overrides the parameter specified in the URI.


=item B<rtmp_buffer>

Set the client buffer time in milliseconds. The default is 3000.


=item B<rtmp_conn>

Extra arbitrary AMF connection parameters, parsed from a string,
e.g. like C<B:1 S:authMe O:1 NN:code:1.23 NS:flag:ok O:0>.
Each value is prefixed by a single character denoting the type,
B for Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z for null,
followed by a colon. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1 for
FALSE or TRUE, respectively.  Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or
1 to end or begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects may
be named, by prefixing the type with 'N' and specifying the name before
the value (i.e. C<NB:myFlag:1>). This option may be used multiple
times to construct arbitrary AMF sequences.


=item B<rtmp_flashver>

Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The default
is LNX 9,0,124,2. (When publishing, the default is FMLE/3.0 (compatible;

is 10.


=item B<rtmp_live>

Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in
live streams is possible. The default value is C<any>, which means the
subscriber first tries to play the live stream specified in the
playpath. If a live stream of that name is not found, it plays the
recorded stream. The other possible values are C<live> and
C<recorded>.


=item B<rtmp_pageurl>

URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no
value will be sent.


=item B<rtmp_playpath>

=item B<rtmp_swfverify>

URL to player swf file, compute hash/size automatically.


=item B<rtmp_tcurl>

URL of the target stream. Defaults to proto://host[:port]/app.


=back


For example to read with B<ffplay> a multimedia resource named
"sample" from the application "vod" from an RTMP server "myserver":

=head2 librtmp rtmp, rtmpe, rtmps, rtmpt, rtmpte


Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through
librtmp.

Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
"--enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace the native RTMP
protocol.

This protocol provides most client functions and a few server
functions needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT),
encrypted RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled
variants of these encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

The required syntax is:
	
	<rtmp_proto>://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>] <options>


where I<rtmp_proto> is one of the strings "rtmp", "rtmpt", "rtmpe",
"rtmps", "rtmpte", "rtmpts" corresponding to each RTMP variant, and
I<server>, I<port>, I<app> and I<playpath> have the same
meaning as specified for the RTMP native protocol.
I<options> contains a list of space-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using
B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i myfile -f flv rtmp://myserver/live/mystream


To play the same stream using B<ffplay>:
	
	ffplay "rtmp://myserver/live/mystream live=1"



=head2 rtp


Real-time Transport Protocol.

The required syntax for an RTP URL is:

Send packets to the source address of the latest received packet (if
set to 1) or to a default remote address (if set to 0).


=item B<localport=>I<n>

Set the local RTP port to I<n>.


=item B<timeout=>I<n>

Set timeout (in microseconds) of socket I/O operations to I<n>.

This is a deprecated option. Instead, B<localrtpport> should be
used.


=back


Important notes:


=over 4



=item 1.

If B<rtcpport> is not set the RTCP port will be set to the RTP
port value plus 1.


=item 2.

If B<localrtpport> (the local RTP port) is not set any available
port will be used for the local RTP and RTCP ports.


=item 3.

If B<localrtcpport> (the local RTCP port) is not set it will be
set to the local RTP port value plus 1.

=back



=head2 rtsp


Real-Time Streaming Protocol.

RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a demuxer
and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data transferred
over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and Real-RTSP (with
data transferred over RDT).

The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock's
E<lt>B<https://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server>E<gt>).

The required syntax for a RTSP url is:
	
	rtsp://<hostname>[:<port>]/<path>


Options can be set on the B<ffmpeg>/B<ffplay> command
line, or set in code via C<AVOption>s or in
C<avformat_open_input>.

The following options are supported.


=over 4


=item B<initial_pause>

Do not start playing the stream immediately if set to 1. Default value
is 0.


=item B<rtsp_transport>

Set RTSP transport protocols.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<udp>

Use UDP as lower transport protocol.


=item B<tcp>

Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower
transport protocol.


=item B<udp_multicast>

Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.


=item B<http>

Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for
passing proxies.

=back


Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they are
tried one at a time (if the setup of one fails, the next one is tried).
For the muxer, only the B<tcp> and B<udp> options are supported.


=item B<rtsp_flags>

Set RTSP flags.

The following values are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<filter_src>

Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

=item B<listen>

Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

=item B<prefer_tcp>

Try TCP for RTP transport first, if TCP is available as RTSP RTP transport.

=back


Default value is B<none>.


=item B<allowed_media_types>

Set media types to accept from the server.

The following flags are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<video>


=item B<audio>


=item B<data>


=back


By default it accepts all media types.


=item B<min_port>

Set minimum local UDP port. Default value is 5000.


=item B<max_port>

Set maximum local UDP port. Default value is 65000.


=item B<timeout>

Set maximum timeout (in seconds) to wait for incoming connections.

A value of -1 means infinite (default). This option implies the
B<rtsp_flags> set to B<listen>.


=item B<reorder_queue_size>

Set number of packets to buffer for handling of reordered packets.


=item B<stimeout>

Set socket TCP I/O timeout in microseconds.


=item B<user-agent>

Override User-Agent header. If not specified, it defaults to the
libavformat identifier string.

=back


When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received packets
(since they may arrive out of order, or packets may get lost totally). This
can be disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to zero (via
the C<max_delay> field of AVFormatContext).

When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with B<ffplay>, the
streams to display can be chosen with C<-vst> I<n> and
C<-ast> I<n> for video and audio respectively, and can be switched
on the fly by pressing C<v> and C<a>.


=head3 Examples


The following examples all make use of the B<ffplay> and
B<ffmpeg> tools.


=over 4


=item *

Watch a stream over UDP, with a max reordering delay of 0.5 seconds:
	
	ffplay -max_delay 500000 -rtsp_transport udp rtsp://server/video.mp4



=item *

Watch a stream tunneled over HTTP:
	
	ffplay -rtsp_transport http rtsp://server/video.mp4



=item *

Send a stream in realtime to a RTSP server, for others to watch:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f rtsp -muxdelay 0.1 rtsp://server/live.sdp



=item *

Receive a stream in realtime:
	
	ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp <output>


=back



=head2 sap


Session Announcement Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a
protocol handler in libavformat, it is a muxer and demuxer.
It is used for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the
streams regularly on a separate port.


=head3 Muxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:
	
	sap://<destination>[:<port>][?<options>]


The RTP packets are sent to I<destination> on port I<port>,
or to port 5004 if no port is specified.
I<options> is a C<&>-separated list. The following options
are supported:


=over 4



=item B<announce_addr=>I<address>

Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements to.
If omitted, the announcements are sent to the commonly used SAP
announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or
ff0e::2:7ffe if I<destination> is an IPv6 address.


=item B<announce_port=>I<port>

Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to
9875 if not specified.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP packets,
defaults to 255.


=item B<same_port=>I<0|1>

If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero (the
default), all streams are sent on unique ports, with each stream on a
port 2 numbers higher than the previous.
VLC/Live555 requires this to be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.
The RTP stack in libavformat for receiving requires all streams to be sent
on unique ports.

=back


Example command lines follow.

To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1


Similarly, for watching in B<ffplay>:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255


And for watching in B<ffplay>, over IPv6:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]



=head3 Demuxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:
	
	sap://[<address>][:<port>]


I<address> is the multicast address to listen for announcements on,
if omitted, the default 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net) is used. I<port>
is the port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

The demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.
Once an announcement is received, it tries to receive that particular stream.

Example command lines follow.

To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://


To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]



=head2 sctp


Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

The accepted URL syntax is:
	
	sctp://<host>:<port>[?<options>]


The protocol accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<listen>

If set to any value, listen for an incoming connection. Outgoing connection is done by default.


=item B<max_streams>

Set the maximum number of streams. By default no limit is set.

=back



=head2 srt


Haivision Secure Reliable Transport Protocol via libsrt.

The supported syntax for a SRT URL is:
	
	srt://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

or

	
	<options> srt://<hostname>:<port>


I<options> contains a list of '-I<key> I<val>'
options.

This protocol accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<connect_timeout=>I<milliseconds>

Connection timeout; SRT cannot connect for RTT E<gt> 1500 msec
(2 handshake exchanges) with the default connect timeout of
3 seconds. This option applies to the caller and rendezvous
connection modes. The connect timeout is 10 times the value
set for the rendezvous mode (which can be used as a
workaround for this connection problem with earlier versions).


=item B<ffs=>I<bytes>

Flight Flag Size (Window Size), in bytes. FFS is actually an
internal parameter and you should set it to not less than
B<recv_buffer_size> and B<mss>. The default value
is relatively large, therefore unless you set a very large receiver buffer,
you do not need to change this option. Default value is 25600.


=item B<inputbw=>I<bytes/seconds>

Sender nominal input rate, in bytes per seconds. Used along with
B<oheadbw>, when B<maxbw> is set to relative (0), to
calculate maximum sending rate when recovery packets are sent
along with the main media stream:
B<inputbw> * (100 + B<oheadbw>) / 100
if B<inputbw> is not set while B<maxbw> is set to
relative (0), the actual input rate is evaluated inside
the library. Default value is 0.


=item B<iptos=>I<tos>

IP Type of Service. Applies to sender only. Default value is 0xB8.


=item B<ipttl=>I<ttl>

IP Time To Live. Applies to sender only. Default value is 64.


=item B<latency=>I<microseconds>

Timestamp-based Packet Delivery Delay.
Used to absorb bursts of missed packet retransmissions.
This flag sets both B<rcvlatency> and B<peerlatency>
to the same value. Note that prior to version 1.3.0
this is the only flag to set the latency, however
this is effectively equivalent to setting B<peerlatency>,
when side is sender and B<rcvlatency>
when side is receiver, and the bidirectional stream
sending is not supported.


=item B<listen_timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set socket listen timeout.


=item B<maxbw=>I<bytes/seconds>

Maximum sending bandwidth, in bytes per seconds.
-1 infinite (CSRTCC limit is 30mbps)
0 relative to input rate (see B<inputbw>)
E<gt>0 absolute limit value
Default value is 0 (relative)


=item B<mode=>I<caller|listener|rendezvous>

Connection mode.
B<caller> opens client connection.
B<listener> starts server to listen for incoming connections.
B<rendezvous> use Rendez-Vous connection mode.
Default value is caller.


=item B<mss=>I<bytes>

Maximum Segment Size, in bytes. Used for buffer allocation
and rate calculation using a packet counter assuming fully
filled packets. The smallest MSS between the peers is
used. This is 1500 by default in the overall internet.
This is the maximum size of the UDP packet and can be
only decreased, unless you have some unusual dedicated
network settings. Default value is 1500.


=item B<nakreport=>I<1|0>

If set to 1, Receiver will send `UMSG_LOSSREPORT` messages
periodically until a lost packet is retransmitted or
intentionally dropped. Default value is 1.


=item B<oheadbw=>I<percents>

Recovery bandwidth overhead above input rate, in percents.
See B<inputbw>. Default value is 25%.


=item B<passphrase=>I<string>

HaiCrypt Encryption/Decryption Passphrase string, length
from 10 to 79 characters. The passphrase is the shared
secret between the sender and the receiver. It is used
to generate the Key Encrypting Key using PBKDF2
(Password-Based Key Derivation Function). It is used
only if B<pbkeylen> is non-zero. It is used on
the receiver only if the received data is encrypted.
The configured passphrase cannot be recovered (write-only).


=item B<enforced_encryption=>I<1|0>

If true, both connection parties must have the same password
set (including empty, that is, with no encryption). If the
password doesn't match or only one side is unencrypted,
the connection is rejected. Default is true.


=item B<kmrefreshrate=>I<packets>

The number of packets to be transmitted after which the
encryption key is switched to a new key. Default is -1.
-1 means auto (0x1000000 in srt library). The range for
this option is integers in the 0 - C<INT_MAX>.


=item B<kmpreannounce=>I<packets>

The interval between when a new encryption key is sent and
when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the
subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and
when the old encryption key is decommissioned. Default is -1.
-1 means auto (0x1000 in srt library). The range for
this option is integers in the 0 - C<INT_MAX>.


=item B<payload_size=>I<bytes>

Sets the maximum declared size of a packet transferred
during the single call to the sending function in Live
mode. Use 0 if this value isn't used (which is default in
file mode).
Default is -1 (automatic), which typically means MPEG-TS;
if you are going to use SRT
to send any different kind of payload, such as, for example,
wrapping a live stream in very small frames, then you can
use a bigger maximum frame size, though not greater than
1456 bytes.


=item B<pkt_size=>I<bytes>

Alias for B<payload_size>.


=item B<peerlatency=>I<microseconds>

The latency value (as described in B<rcvlatency>) that is
set by the sender side as a minimum value for the receiver.


=item B<pbkeylen=>I<bytes>

Sender encryption key length, in bytes.
Only can be set to 0, 16, 24 and 32.
Enable sender encryption if not 0.
Not required on receiver (set to 0),
key size obtained from sender in HaiCrypt handshake.
Default value is 0.


=item B<rcvlatency=>I<microseconds>

The time that should elapse since the moment when the
packet was sent and the moment when it's delivered to
the receiver application in the receiving function.
This time should be a buffer time large enough to cover
the time spent for sending, unexpectedly extended RTT
time, and the time needed to retransmit the lost UDP
packet. The effective latency value will be the maximum
of this options' value and the value of B<peerlatency>
set by the peer side. Before version 1.3.0 this option
is only available as B<latency>.


=item B<recv_buffer_size=>I<bytes>

Set UDP receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.


=item B<send_buffer_size=>I<bytes>

Set UDP send buffer size, expressed in bytes.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeouts for read, write and connect operations. Note that the
SRT library has internal timeouts which can be controlled separately, the
value set here is only a cap on those.


=item B<tlpktdrop=>I<1|0>

Too-late Packet Drop. When enabled on receiver, it skips
missing packets that have not been delivered in time and
delivers the following packets to the application when
their time-to-play has come. It also sends a fake ACK to
the sender. When enabled on sender and enabled on the
receiving peer, the sender drops the older packets that
have no chance of being delivered in time. It was
automatically enabled in the sender if the receiver
supports it.


=item B<sndbuf=>I<bytes>

Set send buffer size, expressed in bytes.


=item B<rcvbuf=>I<bytes>

Set receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.

Receive buffer must not be greater than B<ffs>.


=item B<lossmaxttl=>I<packets>

The value up to which the Reorder Tolerance may grow. When
Reorder Tolerance is E<gt> 0, then packet loss report is delayed
until that number of packets come in. Reorder Tolerance
increases every time a "belated" packet has come, but it
wasn't due to retransmission (that is, when UDP packets tend
to come out of order), with the difference between the latest
sequence and this packet's sequence, and not more than the
value of this option. By default it's 0, which means that this
mechanism is turned off, and the loss report is always sent
immediately upon experiencing a "gap" in sequences.


=item B<minversion>

The minimum SRT version that is required from the peer. A connection
to a peer that does not satisfy the minimum version requirement
will be rejected.

The version format in hex is 0xXXYYZZ for x.y.z in human readable
form.


=item B<streamid=>I<string>

A string limited to 512 characters that can be set on the socket prior
to connecting. This stream ID will be able to be retrieved by the
listener side from the socket that is returned from srt_accept and
was connected by a socket with that set stream ID. SRT does not enforce
any special interpretation of the contents of this string.
This option doesn’t make sense in Rendezvous connection; the result
might be that simply one side will override the value from the other
side and it’s the matter of luck which one would win


=item B<smoother=>I<live|file>

The type of Smoother used for the transmission for that socket, which
is responsible for the transmission and congestion control. The Smoother
type must be exactly the same on both connecting parties, otherwise
the connection is rejected.


=item B<messageapi=>I<1|0>

When set, this socket uses the Message API, otherwise it uses Buffer
API. Note that in live mode (see B<transtype>) there’s only
message API available. In File mode you can chose to use one of two modes:

Stream API (default, when this option is false). In this mode you may
send as many data as you wish with one sending instruction, or even use
dedicated functions that read directly from a file. The internal facility
will take care of any speed and congestion control. When receiving, you
can also receive as many data as desired, the data not extracted will be
waiting for the next call. There is no boundary between data portions in
the Stream mode.

Message API. In this mode your single sending instruction passes exactly
one piece of data that has boundaries (a message). Contrary to Live mode,
this message may span across multiple UDP packets and the only size
limitation is that it shall fit as a whole in the sending buffer. The
receiver shall use as large buffer as necessary to receive the message,
otherwise the message will not be given up. When the message is not
complete (not all packets received or there was a packet loss) it will
not be given up.


=item B<transtype=>I<live|file>

Sets the transmission type for the socket, in particular, setting this
option sets multiple other parameters to their default values as required
for a particular transmission type.

live: Set options as for live transmission. In this mode, you should
send by one sending instruction only so many data that fit in one UDP packet,
and limited to the value defined first in B<payload_size> (1316 is
default in this mode). There is no speed control in this mode, only the
bandwidth control, if configured, in order to not exceed the bandwidth with
the overhead transmission (retransmitted and control packets).

file: Set options as for non-live transmission. See B<messageapi>
for further explanations


=item B<linger=>I<seconds>

The number of seconds that the socket waits for unsent data when closing.
Default is -1. -1 means auto (off with 0 seconds in live mode, on with 180
seconds in file mode). The range for this option is integers in the
0 - C<INT_MAX>.

I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<listen=>I<2|1|0>

Listen for an incoming connection. 0 disables listen, 1 enables listen in
single client mode, 2 enables listen in multi-client mode. Default value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<listen_timeout=>I<milliseconds>

Set listen timeout, expressed in milliseconds.


=item B<recv_buffer_size=>I<bytes>

=head2 tls


Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:
	
	tls://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


The following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):


=over 4



=item B<ca_file, cafile=>I<filename>

A file containing certificate authority (CA) root certificates to treat
as trusted. If the linked TLS library contains a default this might not
need to be specified for verification to work, but not all libraries and
setups have defaults built in.
The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.


=item B<tls_verify=>I<1|0>

If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are communicating with.
Note, if using OpenSSL, this currently only makes sure that the
peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in the CA
database, but it does not validate that the certificate actually
matches the host name we are trying to connect to. (With other backends,
the host name is validated as well.)

This is disabled by default since it requires a CA database to be
provided by the caller in many cases.


=item B<cert_file, cert=>I<filename>

A file containing a certificate to use in the handshake with the peer.
(When operating as server, in listen mode, this is more often required
by the peer, while client certificates only are mandated in certain
setups.)


=item B<key_file, key=>I<filename>

A file containing the private key for the certificate.


=item B<listen=>I<1|0>

If enabled, listen for connections on the provided port, and assume
the server role in the handshake instead of the client role.


=item B<http_proxy>

The HTTP proxy to tunnel through, e.g. C<http://example.com:1234>.
The proxy must support the CONNECT method.


=back


Example command lines:

To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tls://<hostname>:<port>?listen&cert=<server.crt>&key=<server.key>


To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using B<ffplay>:

	
	ffplay tls://<hostname>:<port>



=head2 udp


User Datagram Protocol.

The required syntax for an UDP URL is:
	
	udp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form I<key>=I<val>.

In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
to store the incoming data, which allows one to reduce loss of data due to
UDP socket buffer overruns. The I<fifo_size> and
I<overrun_nonfatal> options are related to this buffer.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<buffer_size=>I<size>

Set the UDP maximum socket buffer size in bytes. This is used to set either
the receive or send buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.
Default is 32 KB for output, 384 KB for input.  See also I<fifo_size>.


=item B<bitrate=>I<bitrate>

If set to nonzero, the output will have the specified constant bitrate if the
input has enough packets to sustain it.


=item B<burst_bits=>I<bits>

When using I<bitrate> this specifies the maximum number of bits in
packet bursts.


=item B<localport=>I<port>

Override the local UDP port to bind with.


=item B<localaddr=>I<addr>

Local IP address of a network interface used for sending packets or joining
multicast groups.


=item B<pkt_size=>I<size>

Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.


=item B<reuse=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Set the time to live value (for multicast only).


=item B<connect=>I<1|0>

Initialize the UDP socket with C<connect()>. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination
unreachable" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.


=item B<sources=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Only receive packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast,
also subscribe to multicast traffic coming from these addresses only.


=item B<block=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Ignore packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast, also
exclude the source addresses in the multicast subscription.


=item B<fifo_size=>I<units>

Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.


=item B<overrun_nonfatal=>I<1|0>

Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default
value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<broadcast=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow UDP broadcasting.

Note that broadcasting may not work properly on networks having
a broadcast storm protection.

Unix local socket

The required syntax for a Unix socket URL is:

	
	unix://<filepath>


The following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):


=over 4


=item B<timeout>

Timeout in ms.

=item B<listen>

Create the Unix socket in listening mode.

=back



=head2 zmq


ZeroMQ asynchronous messaging using the libzmq library.

This library supports unicast streaming to multiple clients without relying on
an external server.

The required syntax for streaming or connecting to a stream is:
	
	zmq:tcp://ip-address:port


Example:
Create a localhost stream on port 5555:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555


Multiple clients may connect to the stream using:
	
	ffplay zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555


Streaming to multiple clients is implemented using a ZeroMQ Pub-Sub pattern.
The server side binds to a port and publishes data. Clients connect to the
server (via IP address/port) and subscribe to the stream. The order in which
the server and client start generally does not matter.

ffmpeg must be compiled with the --enable-libzmq option to support
this protocol.

Options can be set on the B<ffmpeg>/B<ffplay> command
line. The following options are supported:


=over 4



=item B<pkt_size>

Forces the maximum packet size for sending/receiving data. The default value is
131,072 bytes. On the server side, this sets the maximum size of sent packets
via ZeroMQ. On the clients, it sets an internal buffer size for receiving
packets. Note that pkt_size on the clients should be equal to or greater than
pkt_size on the server. Otherwise the received message may be truncated causing
decoding errors.


=back




=head1 DEVICE OPTIONS


The libavdevice library provides the same interface as
libavformat. Namely, an input device is considered like a demuxer, and
an output device like a muxer, and the interface and generic device
options are the same provided by libavformat (see the ffmpeg-formats
manual).

In addition each input or output device may support so-called private
options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the device
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.



=head1 INPUT DEVICES


Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which enable accessing
the data coming from a multimedia device attached to your system.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-indevs".

You can disable all the input devices using the configure option
"--disable-indevs", and selectively enable an input device using the
option "--enable-indev=I<INDEV>", or you can disable a particular
input device using the option "--disable-indev=I<INDEV>".

The option "-devices" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported input devices.

A description of the currently available input devices follows.


=head2 alsa


ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound
installed on your system.

This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the
device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

An ALSA identifier has the syntax:
	
	hw:<CARD>[,<DEV>[,<SUBDEV>]]


where the I<DEV> and I<SUBDEV> components are optional.

The three arguments (in order: I<CARD>,I<DEV>,I<SUBDEV>)
specify card number or identifier, device number and subdevice number
(-1 means any).

To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the
files F</proc/asound/cards> and F</proc/asound/devices>.

For example to capture with B<ffmpeg> from an ALSA device with
card id 0, you may run the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav

android_camera is autodetected during configuration.

This device allows capturing from all cameras on an Android device,
which are integrated into the Camera2 NDK API.

The available cameras are enumerated internally and can be selected
with the I<camera_index> parameter. The input file string is
discarded.

Generally the back facing camera has index 0 while the front facing
camera has index 1.

=back



=head2 avfoundation


AVFoundation input device.

AVFoundation is the currently recommended framework by Apple for streamgrabbing on OSX E<gt>= 10.7 as well as on iOS.

The input filename has to be given in the following syntax:
	
	-i "[[VIDEO]:[AUDIO]]"

The first entry selects the video input while the latter selects the audio input.
The stream has to be specified by the device name or the device index as shown by the device list.
Alternatively, the video and/or audio input device can be chosen by index using the

    B<-video_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

and/or

    B<-audio_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

, overriding any
device name or index given in the input filename.

All available devices can be enumerated by using B<-list_devices true>, listing
all device names and corresponding indices.

There are two device name aliases:

=over 4



=item C<default>

Select the AVFoundation default device of the corresponding type.


=item C<none>

Do not record the corresponding media type.
This is equivalent to specifying an empty device name or index.


=back



=head3 Options


AVFoundation supports the following options:


=over 4



=item B<-list_devices E<lt>TRUE|FALSEE<gt>>

If set to true, a list of all available input devices is given showing all
device names and indices.


=item B<-video_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

Specify the video device by its index. Overrides anything given in the input filename.


=item B<-audio_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

Specify the audio device by its index. Overrides anything given in the input filename.


=item B<-pixel_format E<lt>FORMATE<gt>>

Request the video device to use a specific pixel format.
If the specified format is not supported, a list of available formats is given
and the first one in this list is used instead. Available pixel formats are:
C<monob, rgb555be, rgb555le, rgb565be, rgb565le, rgb24, bgr24, 0rgb, bgr0, 0bgr, rgb0,
 bgr48be, uyvy422, yuva444p, yuva444p16le, yuv444p, yuv422p16, yuv422p10, yuv444p10,
 yuv420p, nv12, yuyv422, gray>


=item B<-framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default is C<ntsc>, corresponding to a
frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<-video_size>

Set the video frame size.


=item B<-capture_cursor>

Capture the mouse pointer. Default is 0.


=item B<-capture_mouse_clicks>

Capture the screen mouse clicks. Default is 0.


=item B<-capture_raw_data>

Capture the raw device data. Default is 0.
Using this option may result in receiving the underlying data delivered to the AVFoundation framework. E.g. for muxed devices that sends raw DV data to the framework (like tape-based camcorders), setting this option to false results in extracted video frames captured in the designated pixel format only. Setting this option to true results in receiving the raw DV stream untouched.

=head2 decklink


The decklink input device provides capture capabilities for Blackmagic
DeckLink devices.

To enable this input device, you need the Blackmagic DeckLink SDK and you
need to configure with the appropriate C<--extra-cflags>
and C<--extra-ldflags>.
On Windows, you need to run the IDL files through B<widl>.

DeckLink is very picky about the formats it supports. Pixel format of the
input can be set with B<raw_format>.
Framerate and video size must be determined for your device with
B<-list_formats 1>. Audio sample rate is always 48 kHz and the number
of channels can be 2, 8 or 16. Note that all audio channels are bundled in one single
audio track.


=head3 Options

Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<format_code E<lt>FourCCE<gt>>

This sets the input video format to the format given by the FourCC. To see
the supported values of your device(s) use B<list_formats>.
Note that there is a FourCC B<'pal '> that can also be used
as B<pal> (3 letters).
Default behavior is autodetection of the input video format, if the hardware

=back



=item B<teletext_lines>

If set to nonzero, an additional teletext stream will be captured from the
vertical ancillary data. Both SD PAL (576i) and HD (1080i or 1080p)
sources are supported. In case of HD sources, OP47 packets are decoded.

This option is a bitmask of the SD PAL VBI lines captured, specifically lines 6
to 22, and lines 318 to 335. Line 6 is the LSB in the mask. Selected lines
which do not contain teletext information will be ignored. You can use the
special B<all> constant to select all possible lines, or
B<standard> to skip lines 6, 318 and 319, which are not compatible with
all receivers.

For SD sources, ffmpeg needs to be compiled with C<--enable-libzvbi>. For
HD sources, on older (pre-4K) DeckLink card models you have to capture in 10
bit mode.


=item B<channels>

Defines number of audio channels to capture. Must be B<2>, B<8> or B<16>.
Defaults to B<2>.


=item B<duplex_mode>

Sets the decklink device duplex mode. Must be B<unset>, B<half> or B<full>.
Defaults to B<unset>.


=item B<timecode_format>

Timecode type to include in the frame and video stream metadata. Must be
B<none>, B<rp188vitc>, B<rp188vitc2>, B<rp188ltc>,
B<rp188hfr>, B<rp188any>, B<vitc>, B<vitc2>, or B<serial>.
Defaults to B<none> (not included).

In order to properly support 50/60 fps timecodes, the ordering of the queried
timecode types for B<rp188any> is HFR, VITC1, VITC2 and LTC for E<gt>30 fps
content. Note that this is slightly different to the ordering used by the
DeckLink API, which is HFR, VITC1, LTC, VITC2.


=item B<video_input>

Sets the video input source. Must be B<unset>, B<sdi>, B<hdmi>,
B<optical_sdi>, B<component>, B<composite> or B<s_video>.

Sets the video packet timestamp source. Must be B<video>, B<audio>,
B<reference>, B<wallclock> or B<abs_wallclock>.
Defaults to B<video>.


=item B<audio_pts>

Sets the audio packet timestamp source. Must be B<video>, B<audio>,
B<reference>, B<wallclock> or B<abs_wallclock>.
Defaults to B<audio>.


=item B<draw_bars>

If set to B<true>, color bars are drawn in the event of a signal loss.
Defaults to B<true>.


=item B<queue_size>

Sets maximum input buffer size in bytes. If the buffering reaches this value,
incoming frames will be dropped.
Defaults to B<1073741824>.


=item B<audio_depth>

Sets the audio sample bit depth. Must be B<16> or B<32>.
Defaults to B<16>.


=item B<decklink_copyts>

If set to B<true>, timestamps are forwarded as they are without removing
the initial offset.
Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<timestamp_align>

Capture start time alignment in seconds. If set to nonzero, input frames are
dropped till the system timestamp aligns with configured value.
Alignment difference of up to one frame duration is tolerated.
This is useful for maintaining input synchronization across N different
hardware devices deployed for 'N-way' redundancy. The system time of different
hardware devices should be synchronized with protocols such as NTP or PTP,
before using this option.
Note that this method is not foolproof. In some border cases input
synchronization may not happen due to thread scheduling jitters in the OS.
Either sync could go wrong by 1 frame or in a rarer case
B<timestamp_align> seconds.
Defaults to B<0>.


=item B<wait_for_tc (>I<bool>B<)>

Drop frames till a frame with timecode is received. Sometimes serial timecode
isn't received with the first input frame. If that happens, the stored stream
timecode will be inaccurate. If this option is set to B<true>, input frames
are dropped till a frame with timecode is received.
Option I<timecode_format> must be specified.
Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<enable_klv(>I<bool>B<)>

If set to B<true>, extracts KLV data from VANC and outputs KLV packets.
KLV VANC packets are joined based on MID and PSC fields and aggregated into
one KLV packet.
Defaults to B<false>.

DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64 project.
Currently only audio and video devices are supported.

Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be
opened on the same input, which should improve synchronism between them.

=head2 fbdev


Linux framebuffer input device.

The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction
layer to show graphics on a computer monitor, typically on the
console. It is accessed through a file device node, usually
F</dev/fb0>.

For more detailed information read the file
Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux source tree.

See also E<lt>B<http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/>E<gt>, and fbset(1).

To record from the framebuffer device F</dev/fb0> with
B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f fbdev -framerate 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi


You can take a single screenshot image with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f fbdev -framerate 1 -i /dev/fb0 -frames:v 1 screenshot.jpeg

=head2 gdigrab


Win32 GDI-based screen capture device.

This device allows you to capture a region of the display on Windows.

There are two options for the input filename:
	
	desktop

or
	
	title=<window_title>


The first option will capture the entire desktop, or a fixed region of the
desktop. The second option will instead capture the contents of a single
window, regardless of its position on the screen.

For example, to grab the entire desktop using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i desktop out.mpg


Grab a 640x480 region at position C<10,20>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -video_size vga -i desktop out.mpg


Grab the contents of the window named "Calculator"
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i title=Calculator out.mpg



=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<draw_mouse>

Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. Use the value C<0> to
not draw the pointer. Default value is C<1>.


=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

Note that I<show_region> is incompatible with grabbing the contents
of a single window.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -show_region 1 -framerate 6 -video_size cif -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -i desktop out.mpg



=item B<video_size>

Set the video frame size. The default is to capture the full screen if F<desktop> is selected, or the full window size if F<title=I<window_title>> is selected.


=item B<offset_x>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the left edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned to the left of your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_x> value to move the region to that monitor.


=item B<offset_y>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the top edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned above your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_y> value to move the region to that monitor.

=head2 iec61883


FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and
libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the configure option
C<--enable-libiec61883> to compile with the device enabled.

The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video device
connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883 and the new Linux
FireWire stack (juju). This is the default DV/HDV input method in Linux
Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since the old FireWire stack was removed.

Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or "auto"
to choose the first port connected.


=head3 Options

=item B<dvtype>

Override autodetection of DV/HDV. This should only be used if auto
detection does not work, or if usage of a different device type
should be prohibited. Treating a DV device as HDV (or vice versa) will
not work and result in undefined behavior.
The values B<auto>, B<dv> and B<hdv> are supported.


=item B<dvbuffer>

Set maximum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV, this
is an exact value. For HDV, it is not frame exact, since HDV does
not have a fixed frame size.


=item B<dvguid>

Select the capture device by specifying its GUID. Capturing will only
be performed from the specified device and fails if no device with the
given GUID is found. This is useful to select the input if multiple
devices are connected at the same time.
Look at /sys/bus/firewire/devices to find out the GUIDs.

=head2 jack


JACK input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack
installed on your system.

A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for
each audio channel, with name I<client_name>:input_I<N>, where
I<client_name> is the name provided by the application, and I<N>
is a number which identifies the channel.
Each writable client will send the acquired data to the FFmpeg input
device.

Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the B<jack_connect>
and B<jack_disconnect> programs, or do it through a graphical interface,
for example with B<qjackctl>.

To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command
B<jack_lsp>.

Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client
with B<ffmpeg>.
	
	# Create a JACK writable client with name "ffmpeg".
	$ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav
	
	# Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
	$ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000
	
	# List the current JACK clients.
	$ jack_lsp -c
	system:capture_1
	system:capture_2
	system:playback_1
	system:playback_2
	ffmpeg:input_1
	metro:120_bpm
	
	# Connect metro to the ffmpeg writable client.

=head2 kmsgrab


KMS video input device.

Captures the KMS scanout framebuffer associated with a specified CRTC or plane as a
DRM object that can be passed to other hardware functions.

Requires either DRM master or CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run.

If you don't understand what all of that means, you probably don't want this.  Look at
B<x11grab> instead.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<device>

DRM device to capture on.  Defaults to B</dev/dri/card0>.


=item B<format>

Pixel format of the framebuffer.  This can be autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7
or later, but needs to be provided for earlier versions.  Defaults to B<bgr0>,
which is the most common format used by the Linux console and Xorg X server.


=item B<format_modifier>

Format modifier to signal on output frames.  This is necessary to import correctly into
some APIs.  It can be autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7 or later, but will need
to be provided explicitly when needed in earlier versions.  See the libdrm documentation
for possible values.


=item B<crtc_id>

KMS CRTC ID to define the capture source.  The first active plane on the given CRTC
will be used.


=item B<plane_id>

KMS plane ID to define the capture source.  Defaults to the first active plane found if
neither B<crtc_id> nor B<plane_id> are specified.


=item B<framerate>

Framerate to capture at.  This is not synchronised to any page flipping or framebuffer
changes - it just defines the interval at which the framebuffer is sampled.  Sampling
faster than the framebuffer update rate will generate independent frames with the same
content.  Defaults to C<30>.


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4



=item *

Capture from the first active plane, download the result to normal frames and encode.
This will only work if the framebuffer is both linear and mappable - if not, the result
may be scrambled or fail to download.
	
	ffmpeg -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwdownload,format=bgr0' output.mp4



=item *

Capture from CRTC ID 42 at 60fps, map the result to VAAPI, convert to NV12 and encode as H.264.
	
	ffmpeg -crtc_id 42 -framerate 60 -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwmap=derive_device=vaapi,scale_vaapi=w=1920:h=1080:format=nv12' -c:v h264_vaapi output.mp4



=item *

To capture only part of a plane the output can be cropped - this can be used to capture
a single window, as long as it has a known absolute position and size.  For example, to
capture and encode the middle quarter of a 1920x1080 plane:
	
	ffmpeg -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwmap=derive_device=vaapi,crop=960:540:480:270,scale_vaapi=960:540:nv12' -c:v h264_vaapi output.mp4

=head2 lavfi


Libavfilter input virtual device.

This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter
filtergraph.

For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a
corresponding stream which is mapped to the generated output. Currently
only video data is supported. The filtergraph is specified through the
option B<graph>.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<graph>

Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must be
labelled by a unique string of the form "outI<N>", where I<N> is a
number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
generated by the device.
The first unlabelled output is automatically assigned to the "out0"
label, but all the others need to be specified explicitly.

The suffix "+subcc" can be appended to the output label to create an extra
stream with the closed captions packets attached to that output
(experimental; only for EIA-608 / CEA-708 for now).
The subcc streams are created after all the normal streams, in the order of
the corresponding stream.
For example, if there is "out19+subcc", "out7+subcc" and up to "out42", the
stream #43 is subcc for stream #7 and stream #44 is subcc for stream #19.

If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input
device.


=item B<graph_file>

Set the filename of the filtergraph to be read and sent to the other
filters. Syntax of the filtergraph is the same as the one specified by
the option I<graph>.

=head2 video4linux2, v4l2


Video4Linux2 input video device.

"v4l2" can be used as alias for "video4linux2".

If FFmpeg is built with v4l-utils support (by using the
C<--enable-libv4l2> configure option), it is possible to use it with the
C<-use_libv4l2> input device option.

The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device
(e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the
kind F</dev/videoI<N>>, where I<N> is a number associated to
the device.

Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of
I<width>xI<height> sizes and frame rates. You can check which are
supported using B<-list_formats all> for Video4Linux2 devices.
Some devices, like TV cards, support one or more standards. It is possible
to list all the supported standards using B<-list_standards all>.

The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel
version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the real time
clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at
boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The

=head2 x11grab


X11 video input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libxcb
installed on your system. It will be automatically detected during
configuration.

This device allows one to capture a region of an X11 display.

The filename passed as input has the syntax:
	
	[<hostname>]:<display_number>.<screen_number>[+<x_offset>,<y_offset>]


I<hostname>:I<display_number>.I<screen_number> specifies the
X11 display name of the screen to grab from. I<hostname> can be
omitted, and defaults to "localhost". The environment variable
B<DISPLAY> contains the default display name.

I<x_offset> and I<y_offset> specify the offsets of the grabbed
area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They
default to 0.

Check the X11 documentation (e.g. B<man X>) for more detailed
information.

Use the B<xdpyinfo> program for getting basic information about
the properties of your X11 display (e.g. grep for "name" or
"dimensions").

For example to grab from F<:0.0> using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


Grab at position C<10,20>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg



=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<select_region>

Specify whether to select the grabbing area graphically using the pointer.
A value of C<1> prompts the user to select the grabbing area graphically
by clicking and dragging. A single click with no dragging will select the
whole screen. A region with zero width or height will also select the whole
screen. This option overwrites the I<video_size>, I<grab_x>, and
I<grab_y> options. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<draw_mouse>

Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of C<0> specifies
not to draw the pointer. Default value is C<1>.


=item B<follow_mouse>

Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be
C<centered> or a number of pixels I<PIXELS>.

When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing region follows the mouse
pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region; otherwise, the region
follows only when the mouse pointer reaches within I<PIXELS> (greater than
zero) to the edge of region.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to edge:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg



=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.


=item B<region_border>

Set the region border thickness if B<-show_region 1> is used.
Range is 1 to 128 and default is 3 (XCB-based x11grab only).

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg


With I<follow_mouse>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg



=item B<window_id>

Grab this window, instead of the whole screen. Default value is 0, which maps to
the whole screen (root window).

The id of a window can be found using the B<xwininfo> program, possibly with options -tree and
-root.

If the window is later enlarged, the new area is not recorded. Video ends when
the window is closed, unmapped (i.e., iconified) or shrunk beyond the video
size (which defaults to the initial window size).

This option disables options B<follow_mouse> and B<select_region>.


=item B<video_size>

Set the video frame size. Default is the full desktop or window.


=item B<grab_x>


=item B<grab_y>

Set the grabbing region coordinates. They are expressed as offset from
the top left corner of the X11 window and correspond to the
I<x_offset> and I<y_offset> parameters in the device name. The
default value for both options is 0.

calculated.  The default value of 20 (which, with suitable dithering, is
appropriate for a destination bit-depth of 16) gives SoX's 'High Quality'; a
value of 28 gives SoX's 'Very High Quality'.


=item B<cheby>

For soxr only, selects passband rolloff none (Chebyshev) & higher-precision
approximation for 'irrational' ratios. Default value is 0.


=item B<async>

For swr only, simple 1 parameter audio sync to timestamps using stretching,
squeezing, filling and trimming. Setting this to 1 will enable filling and
trimming, larger values represent the maximum amount in samples that the data
may be stretched or squeezed for each second.
Default value is 0, thus no compensation is applied to make the samples match
the audio timestamps.


=item B<first_pts>

For swr only, assume the first pts should be this value. The time unit is 1 / sample rate.
This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
assumption is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative pts due to encoder delay.


=item B<min_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger stretching/squeezing/filling or trimming of the
data to make it match the timestamps. The default is that
stretching/squeezing/filling and trimming is disabled
(B<min_comp> = C<FLT_MAX>).


=item B<min_hard_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger adding/dropping samples to make it match the
timestamps.  This option effectively is a threshold to select between
hard (trim/fill) and soft (squeeze/stretch) compensation. Note that
all compensation is by default disabled through B<min_comp>.
The default is 0.1.


=item B<comp_duration>

For swr only, set duration (in seconds) over which data is stretched/squeezed
to make it match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value,
default value is 1.0.


=item B<max_soft_comp>

For swr only, set maximum factor by which data is stretched/squeezed to make it
match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value, default value
is 0.


=item B<matrix_encoding>

Select matrixed stereo encoding.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

select none

=item B<dolby>

select Dolby

=item B<dplii>

select Dolby Pro Logic II

=back


Default value is C<none>.


=item B<filter_type>

For swr only, select resampling filter type. This only affects resampling
operations.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<cubic>

select cubic

=item B<blackman_nuttall>

select Blackman Nuttall windowed sinc

=item B<kaiser>

select Kaiser windowed sinc

=back



=item B<kaiser_beta>

For swr only, set Kaiser window beta value. Must be a double float value in the
interval [2,16], default value is 9.


=item B<output_sample_bits>

For swr only, set number of used output sample bits for dithering. Must be an integer in the
interval [0,64], default value is 0, which means it's not used.


=back

=head1 FILTERING INTRODUCTION


Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the
following filtergraph.

	
	                [main]
	input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
	            |                             ^
	            |[tmp]                  [flip]|
	            +-----> crop --> vflip -------+


This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one
stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it
back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the
following command to achieve this:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT


The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half of the output video.

Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct
linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example,
I<crop,vflip> are in one linear chain, I<split> and
I<overlay> are separately in another. The points where the linear
chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the
example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to
the labels I<[main]> and I<[tmp]>.

The stream sent to the second output of I<split>, labelled as
I<[tmp]>, is processed through the I<crop> filter, which crops
away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The
I<overlay> filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the
split filter (which was labelled as I<[main]>), and overlay on its
lower half the output generated by the I<crop,vflip> filterchain.

Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.

There exist so-called I<source filters> that do not have an
audio/video input, and I<sink filters> that will not have audio/video
output.



=head1 GRAPH


The F<graph2dot> program included in the FFmpeg F<tools>
directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and issue a
corresponding textual representation in the dot language.

Invoke the command:
	
	graph2dot -h


to see how to use F<graph2dot>.

You can then pass the dot description to the F<dot> program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filtergraph.

For example the sequence of commands:
	
	echo <GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> | \
	tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \
	dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \
	display graph.png


can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the I<GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:
	
	ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

your I<GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> string will need to be of the form:
	
	nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

you may also need to set the I<nullsrc> parameters and add a I<format>
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.



=head1 FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION


A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.

Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.

A filter with no input pads is called a "source", and a filter with no
output pads is called a "sink".



=head2 Filtergraph syntax


A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is recognized by the
B<-filter>/B<-vf>/B<-af> and
B<-filter_complex> options in B<ffmpeg> and
B<-vf>/B<-af> in B<ffplay>, and by the
C<avfilter_graph_parse_ptr()> function defined in
F<libavfilter/avfilter.h>.

A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of ","-separated filter descriptions.

A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of ";"-separated filterchain
descriptions.

A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[I<in_link_1>]...[I<in_link_N>]I<filter_name>@I<id>=I<arguments>[I<out_link_1>]...[I<out_link_M>]

I<filter_name> is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program optionally followed by "@I<id>".
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=I<arguments>".

I<arguments> is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:

=over 4



=item *

A ':'-separated list of I<key=value> pairs.


=item *

A ':'-separated list of I<value>. In this case, the keys are assumed to be
the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the C<fade> filter
declares three options in this order -- B<type>, B<start_frame> and
B<nb_frames>. Then the parameter list I<in:0:30> means that the value
I<in> is assigned to the option B<type>, I<0> to
B<start_frame> and I<30> to B<nb_frames>.


=item *

A ':'-separated list of mixed direct I<value> and long I<key=value>
pairs. The direct I<value> must precede the I<key=value> pairs, and
follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following
I<key=value> pairs can be set in any preferred order.


=back


If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the C<format> filter
takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by
B<|>.

The list of arguments can be quoted using the character B<'> as initial
and ending mark, and the character B<\> for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
B<[]=;,>) is encountered.

The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels I<in_link_1>
... I<in_link_N>, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels I<out_link_1> ... I<out_link_M>, are
associated to the output pads.

When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.

If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain
	
	nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
"L1", the first input pad of overlay is labelled "L2", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.

In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not
specified, "in" is assumed; if the output label of the last filter is not
specified, "out" is assumed.

In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.

Libavfilter will automatically insert B<scale> filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
C<sws_flags=I<flags>;>
to the filtergraph description.

Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:
	
	<NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
	<FILTER_NAME>      ::= <NAME>["@"<NAME>]
	<LINKLABEL>        ::= "[" <NAME> "]"
	<LINKLABELS>       ::= <LINKLABEL> [<LINKLABELS>]
	<FILTER_ARGUMENTS> ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
	<FILTER>           ::= [<LINKLABELS>] <FILTER_NAME> ["=" <FILTER_ARGUMENTS>] [<LINKLABELS>]
	<FILTERCHAIN>      ::= <FILTER> [,<FILTERCHAIN>]
	<FILTERGRAPH>      ::= [sws_flags=<flags>;] <FILTERCHAIN> [;<FILTERGRAPH>]




=head2 Notes on filtergraph escaping


Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of
escaping. See B<the "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual> for more
information about the employed escaping procedure.

A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option
value, which may contain the special character C<:> used to
separate values, or one of the escaping characters C<\'>.

A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which
may contain the escaping characters C<\'> or the special
characters C<[],;> used by the filtergraph description.

Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you
need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special
characters contained within it.

For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
the B<drawtext> filter description B<text> value:
	
	this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters


This string contains the C<'> special escaping character, and the
C<:> special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:
	
	text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one, or more, special characters


A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:
	
	drawtext=text=this is a \\\'string\\\'\\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters

(note that in addition to the C<\'> escaping special characters,
also C<,> needs to be escaped).

Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
C<\> is special and needs to be escaped with another C<\>, the
previous string will finally result in:
	
	-vf "drawtext=text=this is a \\\\\\'string\\\\\\'\\\\: may contain one\\, or more\\, special characters"



=head1 TIMELINE EDITING


Some filters support a generic B<enable> option. For the filters
supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is
evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non-zero,
the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the
next filter in the filtergraph.

The expression accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<t>

timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown


=item B<n>

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0


=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown


=item B<w>


=item B<h>

width and height of the input frame if video

=back


Additionally, these filters support an B<enable> command that can be used
to re-define the expression.

Like any other filtering option, the B<enable> option follows the same
rules.

For example, to enable a blur filter (B<smartblur>) from 10 seconds to 3
minutes, and a B<curves> filter starting at 3 seconds:
	
	smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
	curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process


See C<ffmpeg -filters> to view which filters have timeline support.




=head1 CHANGING OPTIONS AT RUNTIME WITH A COMMAND


Some options can be changed during the operation of the filter using
a command. These options are marked 'T' on the output of
B<ffmpeg> B<-h filter=E<lt>name of filterE<gt>>.
The name of the command is the name of the option and the argument is
the new value.



=head1 OPTIONS FOR FILTERS WITH SEVERAL INPUTS 


Some filters with several inputs support a common set of options.
These options can only be set by name, not with the short notation.


=over 4


=item B<eof_action>

The action to take when EOF is encountered on the secondary input; it accepts
one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<repeat>

Repeat the last frame (the default).

=item B<endall>

End both streams.

=item B<pass>

Pass the main input through.

=back



=item B<shortest>

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.


=item B<repeatlast>

If set to 1, force the filter to extend the last frame of secondary streams
until the end of the primary stream. A value of 0 disables this behavior.
Default value is 1.

=back




=head1 AUDIO FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using C<--disable-filters>.
The configure output will show the audio filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.


=head2 acompressor


A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.
Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to
improve the overall loudness. It's done to get the highest attention
of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track.
If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead"
afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect
but can also destroy a track completely).
The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is
the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings
it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.

Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level
C<threshold> and dividing it by the factor set with C<ratio>.
So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio
of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of
the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release".
C<attack> determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold
before any reduction will occur and C<release> sets the time the signal
has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the
C<makeup> setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and
raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the
source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the C<knee> flattens the
hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.


=item B<mode>

Set mode of compressor operation. Can be C<upward> or C<downward>.
Default is C<downward>.


=item B<threshold>

If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain
reduction.
By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.


=item B<ratio>

Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level
rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.
Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.


=item B<attack>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.


=item B<release>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before
reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.


=item B<makeup>

Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing.
Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.


=item B<knee>

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.


=item B<link>

Choose if the C<average> level between all channels of input stream
or the louder(C<maximum>) channel of input stream affects the
reduction. Default is C<average>.


=item B<detection>

Should the exact signal be taken in case of C<peak> or an RMS one in case
of C<rms>. Default is C<rms> which is mostly smoother.


=item B<mix>

How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1.
Range is between 0 and 1.

The cross fade is applied for specified duration near the end of first stream.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<nb_samples, ns>

Specify the number of samples for which the cross fade effect has to last.
At the end of the cross fade effect the first input audio will be completely
silent. Default is 44100.


=item B<duration, d>

Specify the duration of the cross fade effect. See
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>
for the accepted syntax.
By default the duration is determined by I<nb_samples>.
If set this option is used instead of I<nb_samples>.


=item B<overlap, o>

Should first stream end overlap with second stream start. Default is enabled.


=item B<curve1>

Set curve for cross fade transition for first stream.


=item B<curve2>

Set curve for cross fade transition for second stream.

=back



=head2 acrusher


Reduce audio bit resolution.

This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher
is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled
with. This doesn't change the bit depth at all, it just produces the
effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital".
This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete
bit depths.
Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of
the lower and the upper half of the signal.
An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce "softer" crushing sounds.

Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.
This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones.
The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesn't gate low
signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception,
so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant.
Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set level in.


=item B<level_out>

Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst mountains
(and sometimes large buildings) when talking or shouting; digital echo
effects emulate this behaviour and are often used to help fill out the
sound of a single instrument or vocal. The time difference between the
original signal and the reflection is the C<delay>, and the
loudness of the reflected signal is the C<decay>.
Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.

=back



=head2 aemphasis

=head2 agate


A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal
processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.

Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level I<threshold>
and dividing it by the factor set with I<ratio>. The bottom of the noise
floor is set via I<range>. Because an exact manipulation of the signal
would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over
time. This is done by setting I<attack> and I<release>.

I<attack> determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold
before any reduction will occur and I<release> sets the time the signal
has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.


=over 4

Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.


=item B<mode>

Set the mode of operation. Can be C<upward> or C<downward>.
Default is C<downward>. If set to C<upward> mode, higher parts of signal
will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
Otherwise, in case of C<downward> lower parts of signal will be reduced.


=item B<range>

Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.
Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.


=item B<threshold>

If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.
Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.


=item B<ratio>

Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced.
Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.

reduction stops.
Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<release>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the
reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<makeup>

Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

=head2 amerge


Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<inputs>

Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.


=back


If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.

For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input
is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).

On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the
shortest.

Note that this filter only supports float samples (the I<amerge>
and I<pan> audio filters support many formats). If the I<amix>
input has integer samples then B<aresample> will be automatically
inserted to perform the conversion to float samples.

For example
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT

=head2 apulsator


Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo.
But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume
of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with
different waveforms and shifted phases.
This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right
channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other.
The left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional tremolo.
An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted
in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as
an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the
phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some "bypassing" sounds with
sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from
the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the all above options as B<commands>.


=head2 atempo


Adjust audio tempo.

The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not
specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must
be in the [0.5, 100.0] range.

Note that tempo greater than 2 will skip some samples rather than
blend them in.  If for any reason this is a concern it is always
possible to daisy-chain several instances of atempo to achieve the
desired product tempo.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Slow down audio to 80% tempo:
	
	atempo=0.8



=item *

=back



=head3 Commands

=over 4


=item B<tempo>

Change filter tempo scale factor.
Syntax for the command is : "I<tempo>"

=back



=head2 atrim


Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio
sample with the timestamp I<start> will be the first sample in the output.


=item B<end>

Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the
audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp I<end> will be
the last sample in the output.


=item B<start_pts>

Same as I<start>, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples
instead of seconds.


=item B<end_pts>

Same as I<end>, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead
of seconds.


=item B<duration>

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.


=item B<start_sample>

The number of the first sample that should be output.


=item B<end_sample>

The number of the first sample that should be dropped.

=back


B<start>, B<end>, and B<duration> are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the B<duration>
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the
samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will
give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at
zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish
to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the
atrim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

=over 4


=item *

Drop everything except the second minute of input:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120



=item *

Keep only the first 1000 samples:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=end_sample=1000



=back



=head2 axcorrelate

Calculate normalized cross-correlation between two input audio streams.

Resulted samples are always between -1 and 1 inclusive.
If result is 1 it means two input samples are highly correlated in that selected segment.
Result 0 means they are not correlated at all.
If result is -1 it means two input samples are out of phase, which means they cancel each
other.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<size>

Set size of segment over which cross-correlation is calculated.
Default is 256. Allowed range is from 2 to 131072.


=item B<algo>

Set algorithm for cross-correlation. Can be C<slow> or C<fast>.
Default is C<slow>. Fast algorithm assumes mean values over any given segment
are always zero and thus need much less calculations to make.
This is generally not true, but is valid for typical audio streams.

=back

=head2 chorus

Add a chorus effect to the audio.

Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.

Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay is
constant, with chorus, it is varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation.
The modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is played before or after
the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed
sound tuned around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are slightly
off key.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<in_gain>

Set input gain. Default is 0.4.


=item B<out_gain>

Set output gain. Default is 0.4.


=item B<delays>

=head2 compand

Compress or expand the audio's dynamic range.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<attacks>


=item B<decays>

A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. I<attacks> refers to
increase of volume and I<decays> refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.
If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last
set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.


=item B<points>

A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the
maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using
the following syntax: C<x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....> or
C<x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....>

The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function
does not have to be monotonically rising. The point C<0/0> is assumed but
may be overridden (by C<0/out-dBn>). Typical values for the transfer
function are C<-70/-70|-60/-20|1/0>.


=item B<soft-knee>

Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.


=item B<gain>

Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer
function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain.
It defaults to 0.


=item B<volume>

Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering
starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for
example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the
companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially
quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.


=item B<delay>

Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is
delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay
approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively
operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

=head2 compensationdelay


Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing
positions of microphones or speakers.

For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in
different locations. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in
normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on
their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when
these microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of
~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone capture the signal in
antiphase to the other microphone. That makes the final mix sound moody.
This filter helps to solve phasing problems by adding different delays
to each microphone track and make them synchronized.

The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and
synchronize other tracks one by one with it.
Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too.
Higher sample rates will give more tolerance.

The filter accepts the following parameters:

=item B<length>

Default is 3 seconds.

=back



=head2 dynaudnorm

Dynamic Audio Normalizer.

This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order
to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in
contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio.
This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the audio
while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" sections. In other words:
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud
sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the
same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves
this goal *without* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100%
of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file.


=over 4


=item B<framelen, f>

Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds.
Default is 500 milliseconds.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks,
referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no
meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the
peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a "standard"
normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each
frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has
been found to give good results with most files.
Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined
automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file.


=item B<gausssize, g>

Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd
number. Default is 31.
Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the
C<window size> of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter's window size
is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of
simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31
takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and
the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger
smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain
adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing
effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation.
In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a "traditional" normalization filter. On the
contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.


=item B<peak, p>

Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude
level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the
target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also
makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude.
A frame's maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak
magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*.
It is not recommended to go above this value.


=item B<maxgain, m>

Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain
factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not
result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by
the frame's highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
additionally bounds the frame's maximum gain factor by a predetermined
(global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain
factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain
factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and
it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input
with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even
higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does
not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold).
Instead, a "sigmoid" threshold function will be applied. This way, the
gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that
value.


=item B<targetrms, r>

Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization.
This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined
(only) by the frame's highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can
be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal
level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer can also take into account the frame's root mean square,
abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to
determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered
that the RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness" than
just looking at the signal's peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all
frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be
established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame's local gain
factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value.
Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the
frame's highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.


=item B<coupling, n>

Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same
amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e.
the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel.
However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different
channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s).
In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way,
the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending
only on the individual channel's highest magnitude sample. This allows for
harmonizing the volume of the different channels.


=item B<correctdc, c>

Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled.
An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values.
In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the
-1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the
audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around the zero point.
That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a
single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that
value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from
0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a
DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic
Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction.
With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine
the mean value, or "DC correction" offset, of each input frame and subtract
that value from all of the frame's sample values which ensures those samples
are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame
boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly
between neighbouring frames.


=item B<altboundary, b>

Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood
around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as the
subsequent frames. However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very
beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all neighbouring
frames are available. In particular, for the first few frames in the audio
file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few
frames in the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the
question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames
in the "boundary" region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes
to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor
of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and
"fade out" at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.


=item B<compress, s>

Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional"
compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the
full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However,
in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer's
normalization algorithm with a more "traditional" compression.
For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression
(thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled,
all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior
to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is
going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value.
However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold
value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual
frame.
In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa.
Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear.


=item B<threshold, t>

Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible
magnitude level for the audio input which will be normalized.
If input frame volume is above this value frame will be normalized.
Otherwise frame may not be normalized at all. The default value is set
to 0, which means all input frames will be normalized.
This option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to be amplified.

be lower than source LRA and the change in integrated loudness shouldn't
result in a true peak which exceeds the target TP. If any of these
conditions aren't met, normalization mode will revert to I<dynamic>.
Options are C<true> or C<false>. Default is C<true>.


=item B<dual_mono>

=head2 pan


Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output
channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

This filter is also designed to efficiently remap the channels of an audio
stream.

The filter accepts parameters of the form:
"I<l>|I<outdef>|I<outdef>|..."


=over 4


=item B<l>

output channel layout or number of channels


=item B<outdef>

output channel specification, of the form:
"I<out_name>=[I<gain>*]I<in_name>[(+-)[I<gain>*]I<in_name>...]"


=item B<out_name>

output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a channel
number (c0, c1, etc.)


=item B<gain>

multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume unchanged


=item B<in_name>

input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not possible to mix
named and numbered input channels

=back


If the `=' in a channel specification is replaced by `E<lt>', then the gains for
that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus
avoiding clipping noise.


=head3 Mixing examples


For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a bigger
factor for the left channel:
	
	pan=1c|c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1


A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5- and
7-channels surround:
	
	pan=stereo| FL < FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL | FR < FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR


Note that B<ffmpeg> integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system
that should be preferred (see "-ac" option) unless you have very specific
needs.


=head3 Remapping examples


The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:


=over 4


=item *<gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,>


=item *<only one input per channel output,>


=back


If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user ("Pure
channel mapping detected"), and use an optimized and lossless method to do the
remapping.

For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
dropping the extra channels:
	
	pan="stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR"


Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels
and keep the input channel layout:
	
	pan="5.1| c0=c1 | c1=c0 | c2=c2 | c3=c3 | c4=c4 | c5=c5"


If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and
still keep the stereo channel layout) with:
	
	pan="stereo|c1=c1"


Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both
front left and right:
	
	pan="stereo| c0=FR | c1=FR"



=head2 replaygain


ReplayGain scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream as an input and
outputs it unchanged.
At end of filtering it displays C<track_gain> and C<track_peak>.

=head2 sidechaingate


A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to
filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage.
Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the
threshold.
For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal
the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs
appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a
natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted
guitar.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set input level before filtering.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.


=item B<mode>

Set the mode of operation. Can be C<upward> or C<downward>.
Default is C<downward>. If set to C<upward> mode, higher parts of signal
will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
Otherwise, in case of C<downward> lower parts of signal will be reduced.


=item B<range>

Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.
Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.


=item B<threshold>

If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.
Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.


=item B<ratio>

Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced.
Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.


=item B<attack>

reduction stops.
Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<release>

reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<makeup>

Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.


=item B<knee>

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.


=item B<detection>

=head2 silencedetect


Detect silence in an audio stream.

This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less
or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the
minimum detected noise duration.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
C<lavfi.silence_start> or C<lavfi.silence_start.X> metadata key
is set on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection
duration and it contains the timestamp of the first frame of the silence.

The C<lavfi.silence_duration> or C<lavfi.silence_duration.X>
and C<lavfi.silence_end> or C<lavfi.silence_end.X> metadata
keys are set on the first frame after the silence. If B<mono> is
enabled, and each channel is evaluated separately, the C<.X>
suffixed keys are used, and C<X> corresponds to the channel number.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<noise, n>

Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the
specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.


=item B<duration, d>

Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds). See
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>
for the accepted syntax.


=item B<mono, m>

Process each channel separately, instead of combined. By default is disabled.

=head2 silenceremove


Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<start_periods>

This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of
the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the
beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio
the I<start_periods> will be C<1> but it can be increased to higher
values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<start_duration>

Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops
trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated
as silence and trimmed off. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<start_threshold>

This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital
audio, a value of C<0> may be fine but for audio recorded from analog,
you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<start_silence>

Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.


=item B<start_mode>

Specify mode of detection of silence end in start of multi-channel audio.
Can be I<any> or I<all>. Default is I<any>.
With I<any>, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.
With I<all>, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.


=item B<stop_periods>

Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio.
To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a I<stop_periods>
that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
I<start_periods>, making it suitable for removing periods of silence
in the middle of the audio.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<stop_duration>

Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any
more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in
the audio.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<stop_threshold>

This is the same as B<start_threshold> but for trimming silence from
the end of audio.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<stop_silence>

Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.


=item B<stop_mode>

Specify mode of detection of silence start in end of multi-channel audio.
Can be I<any> or I<all>. Default is I<any>.
With I<any>, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.
With I<all>, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.


=item B<detection>

Set how is silence detected. Can be C<rms> or C<peak>. Second is faster
and works better with digital silence which is exactly 0.
Default value is C<rms>.


=item B<window>

Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number
of samples for detecting silence.
Default value is C<0.02>. Allowed range is from C<0> to C<10>.

=head2 speechnorm

Speech Normalizer.

This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio samples
(local set of samples all above or all below zero and between two nearest zero crossings) depending
on threshold value, so audio reaches target peak value under conditions controlled by below options.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4

level for the normalized audio input. Default value is 0.95. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.


=item B<expansion, e>

Set the maximum expansion factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0.
This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The maximum expansion
would be such that local peak value reaches target peak value but never to surpass it and that
ratio between new and previous peak value does not surpass this option value.


=item B<compression, c>

Set the maximum compression factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0.
This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples compression. This option is used
only if B<threshold> option is set to value greater than 0.0, then in such cases
when local peak is lower or same as value set by B<threshold> all samples belonging to
that peak's half-cycle will be compressed by current compression factor.


=item B<threshold, t>

Set the threshold value. Default value is 0.0. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.
This option specifies which half-cycles of samples will be compressed and which will be expanded.
Any half-cycle samples with their local peak value below or same as this option value will be
compressed by current compression factor, otherwise, if greater than threshold value they will be
expanded with expansion factor so that it could reach peak target value but never surpass it.


=item B<raise, r>

Set the expansion raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.
Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast expansion factor is raised per
each new half-cycle until it reaches B<expansion> value.
Setting this options too high may lead to distortions.


=item B<fall, f>

Set the compression raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.
Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast compression factor is raised per
each new half-cycle until it reaches B<compression> value.


=item B<channels, h>

Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.


=item B<invert, i>

Enable inverted filtering, by default is disabled. This inverts interpretation of B<threshold>
option. When enabled any half-cycle of samples with their local peak value below or same as
B<threshold> option will be expanded otherwise it will be compressed.


=item B<link, l>

Link channels when calculating gain applied to each filtered channel sample, by default is disabled.
When disabled each filtered channel gain calculation is independent, otherwise when this option
is enabled the minimum of all possible gains for each filtered channel is used.

=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Halve the input audio volume:
	
	volume=volume=0.5
	volume=volume=1/2
	volume=volume=-6.0206dB


In all the above example the named key for B<volume> can be
omitted, for example like in:

=back



=head2 volumedetect


Detect the volume of the input video.

The filter has no parameters. The input is not modified. Statistics about
the volume will be printed in the log when the input stream end is reached.

In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of a histogram of the
registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of
the samples).

All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.


=head3 Examples


Here is an excerpt of the output:
	
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409


It means that:

=over 4


=item *

The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.

=item *

The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and -5 dB.

=item *

There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.

=back


In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping,
raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.

=head1 AUDIO SINKS


Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.

defines the incoming buffers' formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to C<avfilter_init_filter> for initialization.

=head2 anullsink


Null audio sink; do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is
mainly useful as a template and for use in analysis / debugging
tools.



=head1 VIDEO FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using C<--disable-filters>.
The configure output will show the video filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available video filters.


=head2 addroi


Mark a region of interest in a video frame.

The frame data is passed through unchanged, but metadata is attached
to the frame indicating regions of interest which can affect the
behaviour of later encoding.  Multiple regions can be marked by
applying the filter multiple times.


=over 4


=item B<x>

Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the frame.

=item B<y>

Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.

=item B<w>

Region width in pixels.

=item B<h>

Region height in pixels.

The parameters I<x>, I<y>, I<w> and I<h> are expressions,
and may contain the following variables:

=over 4


=item B<iw>

Width of the input frame.

=item B<ih>

Height of the input frame.

=back



=item B<qoffset>

Quantisation offset to apply within the region.

This must be a real value in the range -1 to +1.  A value of zero
indicates no quality change.  A negative value asks for better quality
(less quantisation), while a positive value asks for worse quality
(greater quantisation).

The range is calibrated so that the extreme values indicate the
largest possible offset - if the rest of the frame is encoded with the
worst possible quality, an offset of -1 indicates that this region
should be encoded with the best possible quality anyway.  Intermediate
values are then interpolated in some codec-dependent way.

For example, in 10-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter varies between
-12 and 51.  A typical qoffset value of -1/10 therefore indicates that
this region should be encoded with a QP around one-tenth of the full
range better than the rest of the frame.  So, if most of the frame
were to be encoded with a QP of around 30, this region would get a QP
of around 24 (an offset of approximately -1/10 * (51 - -12) = -6.3).
An extreme value of -1 would indicate that this region should be
encoded with the best possible quality regardless of the treatment of
the rest of the frame - that is, should be encoded at a QP of -12.

=item B<clear>

If set to true, remove any existing regions of interest marked on the
frame before adding the new one.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Mark the centre quarter of the frame as interesting.
	
	addroi=iw/4:ih/4:iw/2:ih/2:-1/10


=item *

Mark the 100-pixel-wide region on the left edge of the frame as very
uninteresting (to be encoded at much lower quality than the rest of
the frame).
	
	addroi=0:0:100:ih:+1/5


=back



=head2 alphaextract


Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
is especially useful with the I<alphamerge> filter.


=head2 alphamerge


Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
I<alphaextract> to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha
channel.

For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with I<alphaextract>, you might use:
	
	movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]



=head2 amplify

recordings.

The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as
frame metadata. If a black segment of at least the specified minimum
duration is found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well
as duration is printed to the log with level C<info>. In addition,
a log line with level C<debug> is printed per frame showing the
black amount detected for that frame.

The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black
segment with key C<lavfi.black_start> and to the first frame
after the black segment ends with key C<lavfi.black_end>. The
value is the frame's timestamp. This metadata is added regardless
of the minimum duration specified.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<black_min_duration, d>

for which a picture is considered black.
Default value is 0.98.


=item B<pixel_black_th, pix_th>

Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black".

The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luminance value for which a
pixel is considered "black". The provided value is scaled according to
the following equation:
	
	<absolute_threshold> = <luminance_minimum_value> + <pixel_black_th> * <luminance_range_size>


I<luminance_range_size> and I<luminance_minimum_value> depend on
the input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV full-range
formats and [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats.

Default value is 0.10.

The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum
value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:
	
	blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00



=head2 blackframe


Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to
detect chapter transitions or commercials. Output lines consist of
the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness,
the position in the file if known or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

The filter converts the transfer characteristics, color space and color
primaries to the specified user values. The output value, if not specified,
is set to a default value based on the "all" property. If that property is
also not specified, the filter will log an error. The output color range and
format default to the same value as the input color range and format. The
input transfer characteristics, color space, color primaries and color range
should be set on the input data. If any of these are missing, the filter will
log an error and no conversion will take place.

For example to convert the input to SMPTE-240M, use the command:

=head2 coreimage

Video filtering on GPU using Apple's CoreImage API on OSX.

Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is
processed by video hardware. However, software-based OpenGL implementations
exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It depends on
the respective OSX.

There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a
large variety of options. The filter has to be referenced by its name along
with its options.

The coreimage filter accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<list_filters>

List all available filters and generators along with all their respective
options as well as possible minimum and maximum values along with the default
values.
	
	list_filters=true



=item B<filter>

Specify all filters by their respective name and options.
Use I<list_filters> to determine all valid filter names and options.
Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped
to their respective value range.  Vector and color options have to be specified
by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done.
A special option name C<default> is available to use default options for a
filter.

It is required to specify either C<default> or at least one of the filter options.
All omitted options are used with their default values.
The syntax of the filter string is as follows:
	
	filter=<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...][#<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...]][#...]



=item B<output_rect>

Specify a rectangle where the output of the filter chain is copied into the
input image. It is given by a list of space separated float values:
	
	output_rect=x\ y\ width\ height

If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image.
The output rectangle is automatically cropped at the borders of the input
image. Negative values are valid for each component.
	
	output_rect=25\ 25\ 100\ 100


=back


Several filters can be chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST
transfers allowing for fast processing of complex filter chains.
Currently, only filters with zero (generators) or exactly one (filters) input
image and one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet
usable as intended.

Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the
respective filter kernel. The padding is automatically removed to ensure the
filter output has the same size as the input image.

For image generators, the size of the output image is determined by the
previous output image of the filter chain or the input image of the whole
filterchain, respectively. The generators do not use the pixel information of
this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is
blended onto this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the
output image.

The B<coreimagesrc> video source can be used for generating input images
which are directly fed into the filter chain. By using it, providing input
images by another video source or an input video is not required.

The height of the output video. It defaults to C<ih>.
This expression is evaluated only once during the filter
configuration, or when the B<h> or B<out_h> command is sent.


=item B<x>

The horizontal position, in the input video, of the left edge of the output
video. It defaults to C<(in_w-out_w)/2>.
This expression is evaluated per-frame.


=item B<y>

The vertical position, in the input video, of the top edge of the output video.
It defaults to C<(in_h-out_h)/2>.
This expression is evaluated per-frame.


=item B<keep_aspect>

If set to 1 will force the output display aspect ratio
to be the same of the input, by changing the output sample aspect
ratio. It defaults to 0.


=item B<exact>

=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown


=item B<t>

=back


The expression for I<out_w> may depend on the value of I<out_h>,
and the expression for I<out_h> may depend on I<out_w>, but they
cannot depend on I<x> and I<y>, as I<x> and I<y> are
evaluated after I<out_w> and I<out_h>.

The I<x> and I<y> parameters specify the expressions for the
position of the top-left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They
are evaluated for each frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it
is approximated to the nearest valid value.

The expression for I<x> may depend on I<y>, and the expression
for I<y> may depend on I<x>.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<w, out_w>


=item B<h, out_h>


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Set width/height of the output video and the horizontal/vertical position
in the input video.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

=back



=head2 cropdetect


Auto-detect the crop size.

It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the
recommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions
correspond to the non-black area of the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<limit>

Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified
from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity
value greater to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24.
You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending
on the bitdepth of the pixel format.


=item B<round>

The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to
16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to
get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when
encoding to most video codecs.


=item B<skip>

Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is skipped.
Default is 2. Range is 0 to INT_MAX.


=item B<reset_count, reset>

Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will
reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to
detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.

This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
indicates 'never reset', and returns the largest area encountered during
playback.

=back




=head2 cue


Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first
passes on B<preroll> amount of frames, then it buffers at most
B<buffer> amount of frames and waits for the cue. After reaching the cue
it forwards the buffered frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its
input.

The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for
realtime output devices like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering
chain and pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output almost
immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.

Perfect frame accuracy cannot be guaranteed, but the result is good enough for
some use cases.


=over 4



=item B<cue>

The cue timestamp expressed in a UNIX timestamp in microseconds. Default is 0.


=item B<preroll>

The duration of content to pass on as preroll expressed in seconds. Default is 0.


=item B<buffer>

The maximum duration of content to buffer before waiting for the cue expressed
in seconds. Default is 0.


=back




=head2 curves


Apply color adjustments using curves.

This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each
component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by I<N> key points
tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel
values from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to be set for
the output frame.

By default, a component curve is defined by the two points I<(0;0)> and
I<(1;1)>. This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is
"adjusted" to its own value, which means no change to the image.

The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
curve (using a natural cubic spline interpolation) will be define to pass
smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points needs to be
strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their I<x> and I<y> values must
be in the I<[0;1]> interval.  If the computed curves happened to go outside
the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<preset>

Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition
to the B<r>, B<g>, B<b> parameters; in this case, the later
options takes priority on the preset values.

=item B<color_negative>


=item B<cross_process>


=item B<darker>


=item B<increase_contrast>


=item B<lighter>


=item B<linear_contrast>


=item B<medium_contrast>


=item B<negative>


=item B<strong_contrast>


=item B<vintage>


=back

Default is C<none>.

=item B<master, m>

Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It
is sometimes called a "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with
B<r>, B<g>, B<b> or B<all> since it acts like a
post-processing LUT.

=item B<red, r>

Set the key points for the red component.

=item B<green, g>

Set the key points for the green component.

=item B<blue, b>

Set the key points for the blue component.

=item B<all>

Set the key points for all components (not including master).
Can be used in addition to the other key points component
options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this
B<all> setting.

=item B<psfile>

Specify a Photoshop curves file (C<.acv>) to import the settings from.

=item B<plot>

Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.

=back


To avoid some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points list need to be
defined using the following syntax: C<x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ...>.


=head3 Commands


This filter supports same B<commands> as options.

Here we obtain the following coordinates for each components:

=over 4


=item I<red>

C<(0;0.11) (0.42;0.51) (1;0.95)>

=item I<green>

C<(0;0) (0.50;0.48) (1;1)>

value.


=head2 dctdnoiz


Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).

This filter is not designed for real time.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sigma, s>

Set the noise sigma constant.

This I<sigma> defines a hard threshold of C<3 * sigma>; every DCT
coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.

If you need a more advanced filtering, see B<expr>.

Default is C<0>.


=item B<overlap>

Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you
may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the
risk of various artefacts.

If the overlapping value doesn't permit processing the whole input width or
height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won't be denoised.

Default value is I<blocksize>-1, which is the best possible setting.


=item B<expr, e>

Set the coefficient factor expression.

For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a
multiplier value for the coefficient.

If this is option is set, the B<sigma> option will be ignored.

The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the I<c>
variable.


=item B<n>

Set the I<blocksize> using the number of bits. C<1E<lt>E<lt>I<n>> defines the
I<blocksize>, which is the width and height of the processed blocks.

The default value is I<3> (8x8) and can be raised to I<4> for a
I<blocksize> of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences
on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a
better de-noising.

=back



=head3 Examples


Apply a denoise with a B<sigma> of C<4.5>:
	
	dctdnoiz=4.5


The same operation can be achieved using the expression system:

If difference between current pixel and reference pixel is less than threshold,
it will be considered as banded.


=item B<range, r>

Banding detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If positive, random number
in range 0 to set value will be used. If negative, exact absolute value
will be used.
The range defines square of four pixels around current pixel.


=item B<direction, d>

Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be compared. If positive,
random direction from 0 to set direction will be picked. If negative, exact of
absolute value will be picked. For example direction 0, -PI or -2*PI radians
will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2 will pick only pixels on same
column.


=item B<blur, b>

If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all four
surrounding pixels. The default is enabled. If disabled current pixel is
compared with all four surrounding pixels. The pixel is considered banded
if only all four differences with surrounding pixels are less than threshold.


=item B<coupling, c>

If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all pixel components are banded,
e.g. banding detection threshold is triggered for all color components.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the all above options as B<commands>.


=head2 displace


Displace pixels as indicated by second and third input stream.

It takes three input streams and outputs one stream, the first input is the
source, and second and third input are displacement maps.

The second input specifies how much to displace pixels along the
x-axis, while the third input specifies how much to displace pixels
along the y-axis.
If one of displacement map streams terminates, last frame from that
displacement map will be used.

Note that once generated, displacements maps can be reused over and over again.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<edge>

Set displace behavior for pixels that are out of range.

Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<blank>

=item B<wrap>

Out of range pixels are wrapped so they point to pixels of other side.


=item B<mirror>

Out of range pixels will be replaced with mirrored pixels.

=back

Default is B<smear>.

=back




=head3 Text expansion


If B<expansion> is set to C<strftime>,
the filter recognizes strftime() sequences in the provided text and
expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of strftime(). This
feature is deprecated.

If B<expansion> is set to C<none>, the text is printed verbatim.

If B<expansion> is set to C<normal> (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.

The backslash character B<\>, followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.

Sequences of the form C<%{...}> are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ':'.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':' or '}'),
they should be escaped.

Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the
B<text> option in the filter argument string and as the filter
argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell,
that makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file avoids these
problems.

The following functions are available:


=over 4



=item B<expr, e>

The expression evaluation result.

It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the I<x> and
I<y> values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants I<text_w> and I<text_h> will have an undefined
value.


=item B<expr_int_format, eif>

Evaluate the expression's value and output as formatted integer.

The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the I<expr> function.
The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are B<x>,
B<X>, B<d> and B<u>. They are treated exactly as in the
C<printf> function.
The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output.
It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.


=item B<gmtime>

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.
It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.


=item B<localtime>

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone.
It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.


=item B<metadata>

Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.

The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.

The second argument is optional and specifies a default value, used when the
metadata key is not found or empty.

Available metadata can be identified by inspecting entries
starting with TAG included within each frame section
printed by running C<ffprobe -show_frames>.

String metadata generated in filters leading to
the drawtext filter are also available.


=item B<n, frame_num>

The frame number, starting from 0.


=item B<pict_type>

A one character description of the current picture type.


=item B<pts>

The timestamp of the current frame.
It can take up to three arguments.

The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to C<flt>
for seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; C<hms> stands
for a formatted I<[-]HH:MM:SS.mmm> timestamp with millisecond accuracy.
C<gmtime> stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as UTC time;
C<localtime> stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as
local time zone time.

The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.

If the format is set to C<hms>, a third argument C<24HH> may be
supplied to present the hour part of the formatted timestamp in 24h format
(00-23).

If the format is set to C<localtime> or C<gmtime>,
a third argument may be supplied: a strftime() format string.
By default, I<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS> format will be used.

=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports altering parameters via commands:

=over 4


=item B<reinit>

Alter existing filter parameters.

Syntax for the argument is the same as for filter invocation, e.g.

	
	fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text='Hello World'


Full filter invocation with sendcmd would look like this:

	
	sendcmd=c='56.0 drawtext reinit fontsize=56\:fontcolor=green\:text=Hello\\ World'


=back


If the entire argument can't be parsed or applied as valid values then the filter will
continue with its existing parameters.

=head2 fieldmatch


Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine C<fieldmatch> needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as B<decimate> in the filtergraph.

The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
C<fieldmatch> will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as B<yadif> before decimation.

In addition to the various configuration options, C<fieldmatch> can take an
optional second stream, activated through the B<ppsrc> option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.

Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project)
and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from
which C<fieldmatch> is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.

The B<decimate> filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.
If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower
framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr
stream: C<dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate>.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<order>

Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Auto detect parity (use FFmpeg's internal parity value).

=item B<bff>

Assume bottom field first.

=item B<tff>

Assume top field first.

=back


Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the
stream.

Default value is I<auto>.


=item B<mode>

Set the matching mode or strategy to use. B<pc> mode is the safest in the
sense that it won't risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when
possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up
outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other
hand, B<pcn_ub> mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness,
but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are
all somewhere in between B<pc> and B<pcn_ub> in terms of risking
jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections
with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in B<p/c/n/u/b meaning> section.

Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<pc>

2-way matching (p/c)

=item B<pc_n>

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed (p/c + n)

=item B<pc_u>

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if still combed (p/c + u)

=item B<pc_n_ub>

2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and trying 4th/5th matches if
still combed (p/c + n + u/b)

=item B<pcn>

3-way matching (p/c/n)

=item B<pcn_ub>

3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of the original matches are
detected as combed (p/c/n + u/b)

=back


The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that
mode assuming B<order>=I<tff> (and B<field> on I<auto> or
I<top>).

In terms of speed B<pc> mode is by far the fastest and B<pcn_ub> is
the slowest.

Default value is I<pc_n>.


=item B<ppsrc>

Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary
input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter
introduction for more details. It is similar to the B<clip2> feature from
VFM/TFM.

Default value is C<0> (disabled).


=item B<field>

Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as
B<order> unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In
certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a
large impact on matching performance. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Automatic (same value as B<order>).

=item B<bottom>

Match from the bottom field.

=item B<top>

Match from the top field.

=back


Default value is I<auto>.


=item B<mchroma>

Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most
cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to C<0>
only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other
artifacts. Setting this to C<0> could also be used to speed things up at
the cost of some accuracy.

Default value is C<1>.


=item B<y0>


=item B<y1>

These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between B<y0> and
B<y1> from being included in the field matching decision. An exclusion
band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may
interfere with the matching. B<y0> sets the starting scan line and
B<y1> sets the ending line; all lines in between B<y0> and
B<y1> (including B<y0> and B<y1>) will be ignored. Setting
B<y0> and B<y1> to the same value will disable the feature.
B<y0> and B<y1> defaults to C<0>.


=item B<scthresh>

Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on
the luma plane. Good values are in the C<[8.0, 14.0]> range. Scene change
detection is only relevant in case B<combmatch>=I<sc>.  The range for
B<scthresh> is C<[0.0, 100.0]>.

Default value is C<12.0>.


=item B<combmatch>

When B<combatch> is not I<none>, C<fieldmatch> will take into
account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the
final match. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<none>

No final matching based on combed scores.

=item B<sc>

Combed scores are only used when a scene change is detected.

=item B<full>

Use combed scores all the time.

=back


Default is I<sc>.


=item B<combdbg>

Force C<fieldmatch> to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and
print them. This setting is known as B<micout> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.
Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<none>

No forced calculation.

=item B<pcn>

Force p/c/n calculations.

=item B<pcnub>

Force p/c/n/u/b calculations.

=back


Default value is I<none>.


=item B<cthresh>

This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This
essentially controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected.
Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing
can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from
C<-1> (every pixel will be detected as combed) to C<255> (no pixel will
be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good
range is C<[8, 12]>.

Default value is C<9>.


=item B<chroma>

Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision.  Only
disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are
causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually,
using B<chroma>=I<0> is usually more reliable, except for the case
where there is chroma only combing in the source.

Default value is C<0>.


=item B<blockx>


=item B<blocky>

Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed
frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which
B<combpel> pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be
declared combed. See the B<combpel> parameter description for more info.
Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up
to 512.

Default value is C<16>.


=item B<combpel>

The number of combed pixels inside any of the B<blocky> by
B<blockx> size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as
combed. While B<cthresh> controls how "visible" the combing must be, this
setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a
window defined by the B<blockx> and B<blocky> settings) on the
frame. Minimum value is C<0> and maximum is C<blocky x blockx> (at
which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known
as B<MI> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.

Default value is C<80>.

=back




=head3 p/c/n/u/b meaning



=head4 p/c/n


We assume the following telecined stream:

	
	Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
	Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4


The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the
first two frames are progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.

When C<fieldmatch> is configured to run a matching from bottom
(B<field>=I<bottom>) this is how this input stream get transformed:

	
	Input stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4
	                B     1 2 3 4 4   <-- matching reference
	
	Matches:              c c n n c
	
	Output stream:
	                T     1 2 3 4 4
	                B     1 2 3 4 4


As a result of the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated.
To perform a complete inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter
after this operation. See for instance the B<decimate> filter.

The same operation now matching from top fields (B<field>=I<top>)
looks like this:

	
	Input stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4   <-- matching reference
	                B     1 2 3 4 4
	
	Matches:              c c p p c
	
	Output stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4
	                B     1 2 2 3 4


In these examples, we can see what I<p>, I<c> and I<n> mean;
basically, they refer to the frame and field of the opposite parity:


=over 4


=item *<I<p> matches the field of the opposite parity in the previous frame>


=item *<I<c> matches the field of the opposite parity in the current frame>


=item *<I<n> matches the field of the opposite parity in the next frame>


=back



=head4 u/b


The I<u> and I<b> matching are a bit special in the sense that they match
from the opposite parity flag. In the following examples, we assume that we are
currently matching the 2nd frame (Top:2, bottom:2). According to the match, a
'x' is placed above and below each matched fields.

With bottom matching (B<field>=I<bottom>):
	
	Match:           c         p           n          b          u
	
	                 x       x               x        x          x
	  Top          1 2 2     1 2 2       1 2 2      1 2 2      1 2 2
	  Bottom       1 2 3     1 2 3       1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3
	                 x         x           x        x              x
	
	Output frames:
	                 2          1          2          2          2
	                 2          2          2          1          3


With top matching (B<field>=I<top>):
	
	Match:           c         p           n          b          u
	
	                 x         x           x        x              x

=head3 Examples


Simple IVTC of a top field first telecined stream:
	
	fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=none, decimate


Advanced IVTC, with fallback on B<yadif> for still combed frames:
	
	fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=full, yadif=deint=interlaced, decimate



=head2 fieldorder


Transform the field order of the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<order>

The output field order. Valid values are I<tff> for top field first or I<bff>
for bottom field first.

=back


The default value is B<tff>.

The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down
by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content.
This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.

If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does
not alter the incoming video.

It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material,
which is bottom field first.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv



=head2 fifo, afifo


Buffer input images and send them when they are requested.

It is mainly useful when auto-inserted by the libavfilter
framework.

It does not take parameters.


=head2 fillborders

Sometimes video can have garbage at the four edges and you may not want to
crop video input to keep size multiple of some number.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<left>

Number of pixels to fill from left border.


=item B<right>

Number of pixels to fill from right border.

Libavfilter will try to pick one that is suitable as input to
the next filter.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<pix_fmts>

frames as necessary.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<fps>

The desired output frame rate. The default is C<25>.


=item B<start_time>

Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for
padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made
about the first frame's expected PTS, so no padding or trimming is done.
For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with duplicates of
the first frame if a video stream starts after the audio stream or to trim any
frames with a negative PTS.

=item *

Sets the fps to 24, using abbreviation and rounding method to round to nearest:
	
	fps=fps=film:round=near


=back



=head2 framepack


Pack two different video streams into a stereoscopic video, setting proper
metadata on supported codecs. The two views should have the same size and
framerate and processing will stop when the shorter video ends. Please note
that you may conveniently adjust view properties with the B<scale> and
B<fps> filters.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<format>

The desired packing format. Supported values are:


=over 4



=item B<sbs>

=item B<lines>

The views are packed by line.


=item B<columns>

The views are packed by column.


=item B<frameseq>

The views are temporally interleaved.


=back



=back


Some examples:

	
	# Convert left and right views into a frame-sequential video
	ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex framepack=frameseq OUTPUT
	
	# Convert views into a side-by-side video with the same output resolution as the input
	ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex [0:v]scale=w=iw/2[left],[1:v]scale=w=iw/2[right],[left][right]framepack=sbs OUTPUT



=head2 framerate


Change the frame rate by interpolating new video output frames from the source
frames.

This filter is not designed to function correctly with interlaced media. If
you wish to change the frame rate of interlaced media then you are required
to deinterlace before this filter and re-interlace after this filter.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<fps>

Specify the output frames per second. This option can also be specified
as a value alone. The default is C<50>.


=item B<interp_start>

Specify the start of a range where the output frame will be created as a
linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [C<0>-C<255>],
the default is C<15>.


=item B<interp_end>

Specify the end of a range where the output frame will be created as a
linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [C<0>-C<255>],
the default is C<240>.


=item B<scene>

Specify the level at which a scene change is detected as a value between
0 and 100 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low
probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher
value means the current frame is more likely to be one.
The default is C<8.2>.


=item B<flags>

Specify flags influencing the filter process.

Available value for I<flags> is:


=over 4


=item B<scene_change_detect, scd>

Enable scene change detection using the value of the option I<scene>.
This flag is enabled by default.

=back


=back



=head2 framestep


Select one frame every N-th frame.

This filter accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<step>

Select frame after every C<step> frames.
Allowed values are positive integers higher than 0. Default value is C<1>.

=back



=head2 freezedetect


Detect frozen video.

This filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects that the
input video has no significant change in content during a specified duration.
Video freeze detection calculates the mean average absolute difference of all
the components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
C<lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start> metadata key is set on the first frame
whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the
timestamp of the first frame of the freeze. The
C<lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration> and
C<lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end> metadata keys are set on the first frame
after the freeze.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<noise, n>

Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the
specified value) or as a difference ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or
0.001.


=item B<duration, d>

Set freeze duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).

=back



=head2 freezeframes


Freeze video frames.

This filter freezes video frames using frame from 2nd input.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<first>

Set number of first frame from which to start freeze.


=item B<last>

Set number of last frame from which to end freeze.


=item B<replace>

Set number of frame from 2nd input which will be used instead of replaced frames.

=back




=head2 frei0r


Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to install the frei0r
header and configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-frei0r>.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<filter_name>

The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable
B<FREI0R_PATH> is defined, the frei0r effect is searched for in each of the
directories specified by the colon-separated list in B<FREI0R_PATH>.
Otherwise, the standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order:
F<HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/>, F</usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/>,
F</usr/lib/frei0r-1/>.


=item B<filter_params>

A '|'-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r effect.


=back


A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is either
"y" or "n"), a double, a color (specified as
I<R>/I<G>/I<B>, where I<R>, I<G>, and I<B> are floating point
numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) or a color description as specified in the
B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>,
a position (specified as I<X>/I<Y>, where
I<X> and I<Y> are floating point numbers) and/or a string.

The number and types of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an
effect parameter is not specified, the default value is set.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Apply the distort0r effect, setting the first two double parameters:
	
	frei0r=filter_name=distort0r:filter_params=0.5|0.01

	frei0r=colordistance:0.2/0.3/0.4
	frei0r=colordistance:violet
	frei0r=colordistance:0x112233



=item *

Apply the perspective effect, specifying the top left and top right image
positions:
	
	frei0r=perspective:0.2/0.2|0.8/0.2


=back

E<lt>B<http://frei0r.dyne.org>E<gt>


=head3 Commands


This filter supports the B<filter_params> option as B<commands>.


=head2 fspp


Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of B<spp>.

It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post-
processing filter, one of them is performed once per block, not per pixel.
This allows for much higher speed.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<quality>

Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 4-5. Default value is C<4>.


=item B<qp>

Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an integer in range 0-63.
If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).


=item B<strength>

Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15 to 32. Lower values mean
more details but also more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother
but also blurrier. Default value is C<0> − PSNR optimal.


=item B<use_bframe_qp>

Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to C<1>. Using this
option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is
C<0> (not enabled).


=back



=head2 gblur


Apply Gaussian blur filter.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sigma>

Set horizontal sigma, standard deviation of Gaussian blur. Default is C<0.5>.


=item B<steps>

Set number of steps for Gaussian approximation. Default is C<1>.


=item B<planes>

Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are filtered.


=item B<sigmaV>

Set vertical sigma, if negative it will be same as C<sigma>.
Default is C<-1>.

=back



=head3 Commands

This filter supports same commands as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.


=head2 geq


Apply generic equation to each pixel.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<lum_expr, lum>

Set the luminance expression.

=item B<cb_expr, cb>

Set the chrominance blue expression.

=item B<cr_expr, cr>

Set the chrominance red expression.

=item B<alpha_expr, a>

Set the alpha expression.

=item B<red_expr, r>

Set the red expression.

=item B<green_expr, g>

Set the green expression.

=item B<blue_expr, b>

Set the blue expression.

=back


The colorspace is selected according to the specified options. If one
of the B<lum_expr>, B<cb_expr>, or B<cr_expr>
options is specified, the filter will automatically select a YCbCr
colorspace. If one of the B<red_expr>, B<green_expr>, or
B<blue_expr> options is specified, it will select an RGB
colorspace.

If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on the other
one. If no alpha expression is specified it will evaluate to opaque value.
If none of chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate
to the luminance expression.

The expressions can use the following variables and functions:


=over 4


=item B<N>

The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from C<0>.


=item B<X>


=item B<Y>

The coordinates of the current sample.


=item B<W>


=item B<H>

The width and height of the image.


=item B<SW>


=item B<SH>

Width and height scale depending on the currently filtered plane. It is the
ratio between the corresponding luma plane number of pixels and the current
plane ones. E.g. for YUV4:2:0 the values are C<1,1> for the luma plane, and
C<0.5,0.5> for chroma planes.

For functions, if I<x> and I<y> are outside the area, the value will be
automatically clipped to the closer edge.

Please note that this filter can use multiple threads in which case each slice
will have its own expression state. If you want to use only a single expression
state because your expressions depend on previous state then you should limit
the number of filter threads to 1.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Flip the image horizontally:
	
	geq=p(W-X\,Y)



=item *

Generate a bidimensional sine wave, with angle C<PI/3> and a
wavelength of 100 pixels:
	
	geq=128 + 100*sin(2*(PI/100)*(cos(PI/3)*(X-50*T) + sin(PI/3)*Y)):128:128



=item *

Generate a fancy enigmatic moving light:
	
	nullsrc=s=256x256,geq=random(1)/hypot(X-cos(N*0.07)*W/2-W/2\,Y-sin(N*0.09)*H/2-H/2)^2*1000000*sin(N*0.02):128:128



=item *

Generate a quick emboss effect:
	
	format=gray,geq=lum_expr='(p(X,Y)+(256-p(X-4,Y-4)))/2'



=item *

Modify RGB components depending on pixel position:
	
	geq=r='X/W*r(X,Y)':g='(1-X/W)*g(X,Y)':b='(H-Y)/H*b(X,Y)'



=item *

Create a radial gradient that is the same size as the input (also see
the B<vignette> filter):
	
	geq=lum=255*gauss((X/W-0.5)*3)*gauss((Y/H-0.5)*3)/gauss(0)/gauss(0),format=gray


=back



=head2 gradfun


Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
regions by truncation to 8-bit color depth.
Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and
dither them.

It is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to
lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and
bring back the bands.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<strength>

The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also
the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from
.51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the
valid range.


=item B<radius>

The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes for smoother
gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed
regions. Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16. Out-of-range
values will be clipped to the valid range.


=back


Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
I<strength>[:I<radius>]


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Apply the filter with a C<3.5> strength and radius of C<8>:
	
	gradfun=3.5:8



=item *

Specify radius, omitting the strength (which will fall-back to the default
value):
	
	gradfun=radius=8



=back

=head2 haldclut


Apply a Hald CLUT to a video stream.

First input is the video stream to process, and second one is the Hald CLUT.
The Hald CLUT input can be a simple picture or a complete video stream.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<shortest>

Force termination when the shortest input terminates. Default is C<0>.

=item B<repeatlast>

Continue applying the last CLUT after the end of the stream. A value of
C<0> disable the filter after the last frame of the CLUT is reached.
Default is C<1>.

=back


C<haldclut> also has the same interpolation options as B<lut3d> (both
filters share the same internals).

This filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

More information about the Hald CLUT can be found on Eskil Steenberg's website
(Hald CLUT author) at E<lt>B<http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html>E<gt>.


=head3 Commands


This filter supports the C<interp> option as B<commands>.


=head3 Workflow examples



=head4 Hald CLUT video stream


Generate an identity Hald CLUT stream altered with various effects:
	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B<haldclutsrc>=8 -vf "hue=H=2*PI*t:s=sin(2*PI*t)+1, curves=cross_process" -t 10 -c:v ffv1 clut.nut


Note: make sure you use a lossless codec.

Then use it with C<haldclut> to apply it on some random stream:
	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i mandelbrot -i clut.nut -filter_complex '[0][1] haldclut' -t 20 mandelclut.mkv


The Hald CLUT will be applied to the 10 first seconds (duration of
F<clut.nut>), then the latest picture of that CLUT stream will be applied
to the remaining frames of the C<mandelbrot> stream.


=head4 Hald CLUT with preview


A Hald CLUT is supposed to be a squared image of C<Level*Level*Level> by
C<Level*Level*Level> pixels. For a given Hald CLUT, FFmpeg will select the
biggest possible square starting at the top left of the picture. The remaining
padding pixels (bottom or right) will be ignored. This area can be used to add
a preview of the Hald CLUT.

Typically, the following generated Hald CLUT will be supported by the
C<haldclut> filter:

	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B<haldclutsrc>=8 -vf "
	   pad=iw+320 [padded_clut];
	   smptebars=s=320x256, split [a][b];
	   [padded_clut][a] overlay=W-320:h, curves=color_negative [main];
	   [main][b] overlay=W-320" -frames:v 1 clut.png


It contains the original and a preview of the effect of the CLUT: SMPTE color
bars are displayed on the right-top, and below the same color bars processed by
the color changes.

Then, the effect of this Hald CLUT can be visualized with:
	
	ffplay input.mkv -vf "movie=clut.png, [in] haldclut"



=head2 hflip


Flip the input video horizontally.

For example, to horizontally flip the input video with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "hflip" out.avi



=head2 histeq

This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a
per-frame basis.

It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an "automatically adjusting contrast filter". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<strength>

Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.


=item B<intensity>

Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately.  The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.


=item B<antibanding>

Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary
the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of
the histogram. Possible values are C<none>, C<weak> or
C<strong>. It defaults to C<none>.

=back




=head2 histogram


Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.

The computed histogram is a representation of the color component
distribution in an image.

Standard histogram displays the color components distribution in an image.
Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of
the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the
current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_height>

Set height of level. Default value is C<200>.
Allowed range is [50, 2048].


=item B<scale_height>

Set height of color scale. Default value is C<12>.
Allowed range is [0, 40].


=item B<display_mode>

Set display mode.
It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<stack>

Per color component graphs are placed below each other.


=item B<parade>

Per color component graphs are placed side by side.


=item B<overlay>

Presents information identical to that in the C<parade>, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

=back

Default is C<stack>.


=item B<levels_mode>

Set mode. Can be either C<linear>, or C<logarithmic>.
Default is C<linear>.


=item B<components>

Set what color components to display.
Default is C<7>.


=item B<fgopacity>

Set foreground opacity. Default is C<0.7>.


=item B<bgopacity>

Set background opacity. Default is C<0.5>.

=head2 hqdn3d


This is a high precision/quality 3d denoise filter. It aims to reduce
image noise, producing smooth images and making still images really
still. It should enhance compressibility.

It accepts the following optional parameters:


=over 4


=item B<luma_spatial>

A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial luma strength.
It defaults to 4.0.


=item B<chroma_spatial>

A floating point number which specifies chroma temporal strength. It defaults to
I<luma_tmp>*I<chroma_spatial>/I<luma_spatial>.

=back



=head3 Commands

This filter supports same B<commands> as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.



=head2 hwdownload


Download hardware frames to system memory.

The input must be in hardware frames, and the output a non-hardware format.
Not all formats will be supported on the output - it may be necessary to insert
an additional B<format> filter immediately following in the graph to get
the output in a supported format.


=head2 hwmap


Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.

This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends
on the input and output formats:

=over 4


=item *

Hardware frame input, normal frame output

Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output.  If the
original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying
something else on part of it), the B<hwmap> filter can be used again
in the next mode to retrieve it.

=item *

Normal frame input, hardware frame output

If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it -
that is, return the original hardware frame.

Otherwise, a device must be provided.  Create new hardware surfaces on that
device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input
and give those frames to the preceding filter.  This will then act like the
B<hwupload> filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when
the input is already in a compatible format.

=item *

Hardware frame input and output

A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the
B<derive_device> option.  The input and output devices must be of
different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is
system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap
to retrieve the original frames.

Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames
on the output corresponding to the frames on the input.

=back


The following additional parameters are accepted:


=over 4


=item B<mode>

Set the frame mapping mode.  Some combination of:

=over 4


=item I<read>

The mapped frame should be readable.

=item I<write>

The mapped frame should be writeable.

=item I<overwrite>

The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame.

This may improve performance in some cases, as the original contents of the
frame need not be loaded.

=item I<direct>

The mapping must not involve any copying.

Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either
direct mapping is not possible or it would have unexpected properties.
Setting this flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail if that is
not possible.

=back

Defaults to I<read+write> if not specified.


=item B<derive_device> I<type>

Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type I<type> from the device the input frames exist on.


=item B<reverse>

In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the sink
and map them back to the source.  This may be necessary in some cases where
a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is
supported by the devices being used.

This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding filter in undefined
ways if there are any additional constraints on that filter's output.
Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.

=back




=head2 hwupload


Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.

The device to upload to must be supplied when the filter is initialised.  If
using ffmpeg, select the appropriate device with the B<-filter_hw_device>
option or with the B<derive_device> option.  The input and output devices
must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is
system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

The following additional parameters are accepted:


=over 4


=item B<derive_device> I<type>

Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type I<type> from the device the input frames exist on.

=back




=head2 hwupload_cuda

C<hq3x> and C<4> for C<hq4x>.
Default is C<3>.

=back



=head2 hstack

All streams must be of same pixel format and of same height.

Note that this filter is faster than using B<overlay> and B<pad> filter
to create same output.

The filter accepts the following option:


=over 4


=item B<inputs>

Set number of input streams. Default is 2.


=item B<shortest>

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input

Specify the hue angle as a number of radians. It accepts an
expression, and defaults to "0".


=item B<b>

Specify the brightness in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and
defaults to "0".

=back


B<h> and B<H> are mutually exclusive, and can't be
specified at the same time.

The B<b>, B<h>, B<H> and B<s> option values are
expressions containing the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<n>

frame count of the input frame starting from 0


=item B<pts>

presentation timestamp of the input frame expressed in time base units

	hue=h=90:s=1



=item *

Same command but expressing the hue in radians:
	
	hue=H=PI/2:s=1



=item *

Rotate hue and make the saturation swing between 0
and 2 over a period of 1 second:
	
	hue="H=2*PI*t: s=sin(2*PI*t)+1"



=item *

Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-in effect starting at 0:
	
	hue="s=min(t/3\,1)"


The general fade-in expression can be written as:
	
	hue="s=min(0\, max((t-START)/DURATION\, 1))"



=item *

Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-out effect starting at 5 seconds:
	
	hue="s=max(0\, min(1\, (8-t)/3))"

=over 4


=item B<b>


=item B<s>


=item B<h>

=head2 hysteresis


Grow first stream into second stream by connecting components.
This makes it possible to build more robust edge masks.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<planes>

Set which planes will be processed as bitmap, unprocessed planes will be
copied from first stream.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.


=item B<threshold>

Set threshold which is used in filtering. If pixel component value is higher than
this value filter algorithm for connecting components is activated.
By default value is 0.

=back


The C<hysteresis> filter also supports the B<framesync> options.


=head2 identity


Obtain the identity score between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained per component, average, min and max identity score is printed through
the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated identity scores of each frame in frame metadata.

In the below example the input file F<main.mpg> being processed is compared
with the reference file F<ref.mpg>.

	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi identity -f null -



=head2 idet


Detect video interlacing type.

This filter tries to detect if the input frames are interlaced, progressive,
top or bottom field first. It will also try to detect fields that are
repeated between adjacent frames (a sign of telecine).

Single frame detection considers only immediately adjacent frames when classifying each frame.
Multiple frame detection incorporates the classification history of previous frames.

The filter will log these metadata values:


=over 4


=item B<single.current_frame>

Detected type of current frame using single-frame detection. One of:
``tff'' (top field first), ``bff'' (bottom field first),
``progressive'', or ``undetermined''


=item B<single.tff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.tff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using multiple-frame detection.


=item B<single.bff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.current_frame>

Detected type of current frame using multiple-frame detection. One of:
``tff'' (top field first), ``bff'' (bottom field first),
``progressive'', or ``undetermined''


=item B<multiple.bff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using multiple-frame detection.


=item B<single.progressive>

Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.progressive>

Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using multiple-frame detection.


=item B<single.undetermined>

Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.undetermined>

Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using multiple-frame detection.

=item B<repeated.neither>

Cumulative number of frames with no repeated field.


=item B<repeated.top>

Cumulative number of frames with the top field repeated from the previous frame's top field.


=item B<repeated.bottom>

Cumulative number of frames with the bottom field repeated from the previous frame's bottom field.

=over 4


=item B<intl_thres>

Set interlacing threshold.

=item B<prog_thres>

Set progressive threshold.

=item B<rep_thres>

Threshold for repeated field detection.

=item B<half_life>

Number of frames after which a given frame's contribution to the
statistics is halved (i.e., it contributes only 0.5 to its
classification). The default of 0 means that all frames seen are given
full weight of 1.0 forever.

=item B<analyze_interlaced_flag>

When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine
if the interlaced flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames.
If the flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any further
computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it will be cleared without any
further computations. This allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational
method to clean up the interlaced flag

=back



=head2 il


Deinterleave or interleave fields.

This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields without
deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input frame into 2
fields (so called half pictures). Odd lines are moved to the top
half of the output image, even lines to the bottom half.
You can process (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<luma_mode, l>


=item B<chroma_mode, c>


=item B<alpha_mode, a>

Available values for I<luma_mode>, I<chroma_mode> and

reduce moire patterns.


=over 4


=item B<0, off>

Disable vertical lowpass filter


=item B<1, linear>

Enable linear filter (default)

=head2 lenscorrection


Correct radial lens distortion

This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use
of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters
one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error.
To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources
and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.

Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and
Digikam from the KDE project.

In contrast to the B<vignette> filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,
this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas B<vignette> corrects the
brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain
cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should
be applied before or after lens correction.


=head3 Options


The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<cx>

Relative x-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
width. Default is 0.5.

=item B<cy>

Relative y-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
height. Default is 0.5.

=item B<k1>

Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means
no correction. Default is 0.

=item B<k2>

Coefficient of the double quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1].
0 means no correction. Default is 0.

=item B<i>

Set interpolation type. Can be C<nearest> or C<bilinear>.
Default is C<nearest>.

=item B<fc>

Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual>. Default color is C<black@0>.

=back


The formula that generates the correction is:

I<r_src> = I<r_tgt> * (1 + I<k1> * (I<r_tgt> / I<r_0>)^2 + I<k2> * (I<r_tgt> / I<r_0>)^4)

where I<r_0> is halve of the image diagonal and I<r_src> and I<r_tgt> are the
distances from the focal point in the source and target images, respectively.


=head3 Commands


This filter supports the all above options as B<commands>.


=head2 lensfun


Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (E<lt>B<http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/>E<gt>).

The C<lensfun> filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model
to apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and
query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As
long as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can
perform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the
filter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will
output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level "info"). You must
provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<make>

The make of the camera (for example, "Canon"). This option is required.


=item B<model>

The model of the camera (for example, "Canon EOS 100D"). This option is
required.


=item B<lens_model>

The model of the lens (for example, "Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM"). This
option is required.


=item B<mode>

The type of correction to apply. The following values are valid options:


=over 4


=item B<vignetting>

Enables fixing lens vignetting.


=item B<geometry>

Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default.


=item B<subpixel>

=item B<vig_subpixel>

Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations.


=item B<distortion>

Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations.


=item B<all>

Enables all possible corrections.


=back


=item B<focal_length>

The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For
example, a 18--55mm lens has focal length range of [18--55], so a value in that
range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.


=item B<aperture>

The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.


=item B<focus_distance>

The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
focus distance is only used for vignetting and only slightly affects the
vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it at the default value (which
is 1000).


=item B<scale>

The scale factor which is applied after transformation. After correction the
video is no longer necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of
the resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value will be chosen
automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area in the output
image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result
in more of the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid
unmapped areas in the output.


=item B<target_geometry>

The target geometry of the output image/video. The following values are valid
options:


=over 4


=item B<rectilinear (default)>


=item B<fisheye>


=item B<panoramic>

out differently over the block.

A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more
than a threshold of B<hi>, and if no more than B<frac> blocks (1
meaning the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of B<lo>.

which pixels should be processed by the predictor neural network and which
can be handled by simple cubic interpolation.
The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation will be
sufficient for a pixel or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn.
The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of
the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation,
using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing.
The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not
using it is almost always unnoticeable.

=head2 normalize


Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast stretching).
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing)

For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps
it linearly to the user-specified output range. The output range defaults
to the full dynamic range from pure black to pure white.

Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce flickering (rapid
changes in brightness) caused when small dark or bright objects enter or leave
the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a
video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of over- or
under-exposure of the video.

The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which may cause some
color shifting, or linked together as a single channel, which prevents
color shifting. Linked normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization
does not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked
normalization can be combined in any ratio.

The normalize filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<blackpt>


=item B<whitept>

Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to
the I<blackpt>. The maximum input value is mapped to the I<whitept>.
The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for
I<blackpt> and black for I<whitept> will give color-inverted,
normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range
(contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting
effects.


=item B<smoothing>

The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. The input range
of each channel is smoothed using a rolling average over the current frame
and the I<smoothing> previous frames. The default is 0 (no temporal
smoothing).


=item B<independence>

Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting) channel normalization to
linked (color preserving) normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully
independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).


=item B<strength>

Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 is a rather
expensive no-op. Defaults to 1.0 (full strength).


=back



=head3 Commands

This filter supports same B<commands> as options, excluding I<smoothing> option.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.


=head3 Examples


Stretch video contrast to use the full dynamic range, with no temporal
smoothing; may flicker depending on the source content:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=0


As above, but with 50 frames of temporal smoothing; flicker should be
reduced, depending on the source content:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50


As above, but with hue-preserving linked channel normalization:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0


As above, but with half strength:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0:strength=0.5

Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.



=head3 dilate


Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function C<cvDilate>.

It accepts the parameters: I<struct_el>|I<nb_iterations>.

I<struct_el> represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
I<cols>xI<rows>+I<anchor_x>xI<anchor_y>/I<shape>

I<cols> and I<rows> represent the number of columns and rows of
the structuring element, I<anchor_x> and I<anchor_y> the anchor
point, and I<shape> the shape for the structuring element. I<shape>
must be "rect", "cross", "ellipse", or "custom".

If the value for I<shape> is "custom", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=I<filename>". The file with name
I<filename> is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
I<shape> is used, I<cols> and I<rows> are ignored, the number
or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.

The default value for I<struct_el> is "3x3+0x0/rect".

I<nb_iterations> specifies the number of times the transform is
applied to the image, and defaults to 1.

Some examples:
	
	# Use the default values
	ocv=dilate
	
	# Dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterating two times
	ocv=filter_name=dilate:filter_params=5x5+2x2/cross|2
	
	# Read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterating two times.
	# The file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this
	#   *
	#  ***
	# *****
	#  ***
	#   *
	# The specified columns and rows are ignored
	# but the anchor point coordinates are not

=head3 smooth


Smooth the input video.

The filter takes the following parameters:

I<type> is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of
the following values: "blur", "blur_no_scale", "median", "gaussian",
or "bilateral". The default value is "gaussian".

The meaning of I<param1>, I<param2>, I<param3>, and I<param4>
depends on the smooth type. I<param1> and
I<param2> accept integer positive values or 0. I<param3> and
I<param4> accept floating point values.

The default value for I<param1> is 3. The default value for the
other parameters is 0.

These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the
libopencv function C<cvSmooth>.

This filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

Note that the I<n>, I<pos>, I<t> variables are available only
when evaluation is done I<per frame>, and will evaluate to NAN
when B<eval> is set to B<init>.

Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea
to pass the two inputs through a I<setpts=PTS-STARTPTS> filter to
have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for
the I<movie> filter does.

You can chain together more overlays but you should test the
efficiency of such approach.


=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Modify the x and y of the overlay input.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Draw the overlay at 10 pixels from the bottom right corner of the main
video:
	
	overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10


Using named options the example above becomes:
	
	overlay=x=main_w-overlay_w-10:y=main_h-overlay_h-10



=item *

Insert a transparent PNG logo in the bottom left corner of the input,
using the B<ffmpeg> tool with the C<-filter_complex> option:
	
	ffmpeg -i input -i logo -filter_complex 'overlay=10:main_h-overlay_h-10' output



=item *

Insert 2 different transparent PNG logos (second logo on bottom
right corner) using the B<ffmpeg> tool:
	
	ffmpeg -i input -i logo1 -i logo2 -filter_complex 'overlay=x=10:y=H-h-10,overlay=x=W-w-10:y=H-h-10' output



=item *

Add a transparent color layer on top of the main video; C<WxH>
must specify the size of the main input to the overlay filter:

=item *

Play an original video and a filtered version (here with the deshake
filter) side by side using the B<ffplay> tool:
	
	ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[a][b]; [a]pad=iw*2:ih[src]; [b]deshake[filt]; [src][filt]overlay=w'


The above command is the same as:
	
	ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[b], pad=iw*2[src], [b]deshake, [src]overlay=w'



=item *

Make a sliding overlay appearing from the left to the right top part of the
screen starting since time 2:
	
	overlay=x='if(gte(t,2), -w+(t-2)*20, NAN)':y=0



=item *

Compose output by putting two input videos side to side:
	
	ffmpeg -i left.avi -i right.avi -filter_complex "
	nullsrc=size=200x100 [background];
	[0:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [left];
	[1:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [right];

=head2 pad


Add paddings to the input image, and place the original input at the
provided I<x>, I<y> coordinates.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Specify an expression for the size of the output image with the
paddings added. If the value for I<width> or I<height> is 0, the
corresponding input size is used for the output.

The I<width> expression can reference the value set by the
I<height> expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<width> and I<height> is 0.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Specify the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area,
with respect to the top/left border of the output image.

The I<x> expression can reference the value set by the I<y>
expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<x> and I<y> is 0.

If I<x> or I<y> evaluate to a negative number, they'll be changed
so the input image is centered on the padded area.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual>.

The default value of I<color> is "black".


=item B<eval>

Specify when to evaluate  I<width>, I<height>, I<x> and I<y> expression.

It accepts the following values:


=over 4


=item B<init>

Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when
a command is processed.


=item B<frame>

Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.


=back


Default value is B<init>.


=item B<aspect>

Pad to aspect instead to a resolution.


=back


The value for the I<width>, I<height>, I<x>, and I<y>
options are expressions containing the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<in_w>


=item B<in_h>

The input video width and height.


=item B<iw>


=item B<ih>

These are the same as I<in_w> and I<in_h>.


=item B<out_w>


=item B<out_h>

The output width and height (the size of the padded area), as
specified by the I<width> and I<height> expressions.


=item B<ow>


=item B<oh>

These are the same as I<out_w> and I<out_h>.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

The x and y offsets as specified by the I<x> and I<y>
expressions, or NAN if not yet specified.


=item B<a>

same as I<iw> / I<ih>


=item B<sar>

input sample aspect ratio


=item B<dar>

input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (I<iw> / I<ih>) * I<sar>


=item B<hsub>


=item B<vsub>

The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Add paddings with the color "violet" to the input video. The output video
size is 640x480, and the top-left corner of the input video is placed at
column 0, row 40
	
	pad=640:480:0:40:violet


The example above is equivalent to the following command:
	
	pad=width=640:height=480:x=0:y=40:color=violet



=item *

Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2,
and put the input video at the center of the padded area:
	
	pad="3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Pad the input to get a squared output with size equal to the maximum
value between the input width and height, and put the input video at
the center of the padded area:
	
	pad="max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:
	
	pad="ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display aspect
correctly, it is necessary to use I<sar> in the expression,
according to the relation:
	
	(ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
	X = output_dar / sar


Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:
	
	pad="ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Double the output size and put the input video in the bottom-right
corner of the output padded area:
	
	pad="2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih"


=back




=head2 palettegen


Generate one palette for a whole video stream.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4

Note: the palette will still contain 256 colors; the unused palette entries
will be black.


=item B<reserve_transparent>

Create a palette of 255 colors maximum and reserve the last one for
transparency. Reserving the transparency color is useful for GIF optimization.
If not set, the maximum of colors in the palette will be 256. You probably want
to disable this option for a standalone image.
Set by default.


=item B<transparency_color>

Set the color that will be used as background for transparency.


=item B<stats_mode>

Set statistics mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4

Compute histograms only for the part that differs from previous frame. This
might be relevant to give more importance to the moving part of your input if
the background is static.

=item B<single>

Compute new histogram for each frame.

=back


Default value is I<full>.

=back


The filter also exports the frame metadata C<lavfi.color_quant_ratio>
(C<nb_color_in / nb_color_out>) which you can use to evaluate the degree of
color quantization of the palette. This information is also visible at
I<info> logging level.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Generate a representative palette of a given video using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf palettegen palette.png

=item B<sierra2>

Frankie Sierra dithering v2 (error diffusion)

=item B<sierra2_4a>

=back


Default is I<sierra2_4a>.


=item B<bayer_scale>

When I<bayer> dithering is selected, this option defines the scale of the
pattern (how much the crosshatch pattern is visible). A low value means more
visible pattern for less banding, and higher value means less visible pattern
at the cost of more banding.

The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5]. Default is I<2>.


=item B<diff_mode>

If set, define the zone to process


=over 4


=item B<rectangle>

Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed. This is similar to GIF
cropping/offsetting compression mechanism. This option can be useful for speed
if only a part of the image is changing, and has use cases such as limiting the
scope of the error diffusal B<dither> to the rectangle that bounds the
moving scene (it leads to more deterministic output if the scene doesn't change
much, and as a result less moving noise and better GIF compression).

=back


Default is I<none>.


=item B<new>

Take new palette for each output frame.


=item B<alpha_threshold>

Sets the alpha threshold for transparency. Alpha values above this threshold
will be treated as completely opaque, and values below this threshold will be
treated as completely transparent.

The option must be an integer value in the range [0,255]. Default is I<128>.

=back



=head3 Examples

=head2 psnr


Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio) between two input videos.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the PSNR.

Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.

The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each
frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames
equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:

	
	PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)


Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the
image.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.


=over 4


=item B<stats_file, f>

If specified the filter will use the named file to save the PSNR of
each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to
standard output.


=item B<stats_version>

Specifies which version of the stats file format to use. Details of
each format are written below.
Default value is 1.


=item B<stats_add_max>

Determines whether the max value is output to the stats log.
Default value is 0.
Requires stats_version E<gt>= 2. If this is set and stats_version E<lt> 2,
the filter will return an error.

=back


This filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

The file printed if I<stats_file> is selected, contains a sequence of
key/value pairs of the form I<key>:I<value> for each compared
couple of frames.

If a I<stats_version> greater than 1 is specified, a header line precedes
the list of per-frame-pair stats, with key value pairs following the frame
format with the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<psnr_log_version>

The version of the log file format. Will match I<stats_version>.


=item B<fields>

A comma separated list of the per-frame-pair parameters included in
the log.

=back


A description of each shown per-frame-pair parameter follows:


=over 4


=item B<n>

=item *

For example:
	
	movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
	[main][ref] psnr="stats_file=stats.log" [out]


On this example the input file being processed is compared with the
reference file F<ref_movie.mpg>. The PSNR of each individual frame
is stored in F<stats.log>.


=item *

Another example with different containers:
	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mkv -lavfi  "[0:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[main];[1:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[ref];[main][ref]psnr" -f null -

=head2 pullup


Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed
hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive
content.

The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making
its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock
onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after
pullup, use C<fps=24000/1001> if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,
C<fps=24> for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<jl>


=item B<jr>


=item B<jt>


=item B<jb>

These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and
bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels,
while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.


=item B<sb>

Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of
filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily.
This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between
the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<mp>

Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<l>

Use luma plane.


=item B<u>

Use chroma blue plane.


=item B<v>

Use chroma red plane.

=back


This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane
for doing filter's computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean
source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there
is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.
The main purpose of setting B<mp> to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU
load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

=back


For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is
necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse
telecine NTSC input:
	
	ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 ...



=head2 qp


Change video quantization parameters (QP).

The filter accepts the following option:

less than C<0>, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a
best effort basis.

=head2 removelogo


Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which
pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.

=back


Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.

If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.


=head2 repeatfields


This filter uses the repeat_field flag from the Video ES headers and hard repeats
fields based on its value.


=head2 reverse

A description of the optional parameters follows.

=over 4


=item B<angle, a>

Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<luma_radius, lr>

Set luma blur filter strength, must be a value in range 0.1-4.0, default
value is 1.0. A greater value will result in a more blurred image, and

=back


Each chroma option value, if not explicitly specified, is set to the
corresponding luma option value.



=head2 scale


Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.

The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

If the input image format is different from the format requested by
the next filter, the scale filter will convert the input to the
requested format.


=head3 Options

The filter accepts the following options, or any of the options
supported by the libswscale scaler.

See B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for
the complete list of scaler options.


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input
dimension.

If the I<width> or I<w> value is 0, the input width is used for
the output. If the I<height> or I<h> value is 0, the input height
is used for the output.

If one and only one of the values is -n with n E<gt>= 1, the scale filter
will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image,
calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will,
however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and
adjust the value if necessary.

If both values are -n with n E<gt>= 1, the behavior will be identical to
both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.

See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension
expression.


=item B<eval>

Specify when to evaluate I<width> and I<height> expression. It accepts the following values:

=item B<0>

Do not apply interlaced scaling.


=item B<-1>

Select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source frames
are flagged as interlaced or not.

=back


Default value is B<0>.


=item B<flags>

Set libswscale scaling flags. See
B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for the
complete list of values. If not explicitly specified the filter applies
the default flags.



=item B<param0, param1>

Set libswscale input parameters for scaling algorithms that need them. See
B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for the
complete documentation. If not explicitly specified the filter applies
empty parameters.




=item B<size, s>

Set the video size. For the syntax of this option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.


=item B<in_color_matrix>


=item B<out_color_matrix>

Set in/output YCbCr color space type.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder.

If not specified, the color space type depends on the pixel format.

Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Choose automatically.


=item B<bt709>

Format conforming to International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
Recommendation BT.709.


=item B<fcc>

=back



=item B<in_range>


=item B<out_range>

Set in/output YCbCr sample range.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder. If not specified, the
range depends on the pixel format. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<auto/unknown>

Choose automatically.


=item B<jpeg/full/pc>

Set full range (0-255 in case of 8-bit luma).


=item B<mpeg/limited/tv>

Set "MPEG" range (16-235 in case of 8-bit luma).

=back



=item B<force_original_aspect_ratio>

Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to
keep the original aspect ratio. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<disable>

Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.


=item B<decrease>

The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.


=item B<increase>

The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.


=back


One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device's
maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to
that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows
1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for B<w>
or B<h>, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option
to work.


=item B<force_divisible_by>

Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the
given integer when used together with B<force_original_aspect_ratio>. This
works similar to using C<-n> in the B<w> and B<h> options.

This option respects the value set for B<force_original_aspect_ratio>,
increasing or decreasing the resolution accordingly. The video's aspect ratio
may be slightly modified.

This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed
a defined resolution using B<force_original_aspect_ratio> but also have

=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Scale the input video to a size of 200x100

=item *

Scale the input to 2x with forced interlaced scaling:
	
	scale=2*iw:2*ih:interl=1

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Set the output video dimension expression.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

=back



=head2 scale_npp


Use the NVIDIA Performance Primitives (libnpp) to perform scaling and/or pixel
format conversion on CUDA video frames. Setting the output width and height
works in the same way as for the I<scale> filter.

The following additional options are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<format>

The pixel format of the output CUDA frames. If set to the string "same" (the
default), the input format will be kept. Note that automatic format negotiation
and conversion is not yet supported for hardware frames


=item B<interp_algo>

The interpolation algorithm used for resizing. One of the following:

=over 4


=item B<nn>

Nearest neighbour.


=item B<linear>


=item B<cubic>


=item B<cubic2p_bspline>

2-parameter cubic (B=1, C=0)


=item B<cubic2p_catmullrom>

2-parameter cubic (B=0, C=1/2)


=item B<cubic2p_b05c03>

2-parameter cubic (B=1/2, C=3/10)

=item B<lanczos>


=back



=item B<force_original_aspect_ratio>

Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to
keep the original aspect ratio. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<disable>

Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.


=item B<decrease>

The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.


=item B<increase>

The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.


=back


One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device's
maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to
that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows
1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for B<w>
or B<h>, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option
to work.


=item B<force_divisible_by>

Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the
given integer when used together with B<force_original_aspect_ratio>. This
works similar to using C<-n> in the B<w> and B<h> options.

This option respects the value set for B<force_original_aspect_ratio>,
increasing or decreasing the resolution accordingly. The video's aspect ratio
may be slightly modified.

This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed
a defined resolution using B<force_original_aspect_ratio> but also have
encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.


=back

scene change or others.

In addition, this filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects
a scene change by B<threshold>.

C<lavfi.scd.mafd> metadata keys are set with mafd for every frame.

C<lavfi.scd.score> metadata keys are set with scene change score for every frame
to detect scene change.

=head2 separatefields


The C<separatefields> takes a frame-based video input and splits
each frame into its components fields, producing a new half height clip
with twice the frame rate and twice the frame count.

This filter use field-dominance information in frame to decide which
of each pair of fields to place first in the output.
If it gets it wrong use B<setfield> filter before C<separatefields> filter.


=head2 setdar, setsar


The C<setdar> filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter
output video.

This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect
Ratio, according to the following equation:
	
	<DAR> = <HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION> / <VERTICAL_RESOLUTION> * <SAR>


Keep in mind that the C<setdar> filter does not modify the pixel
dimensions of the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by
this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain,
e.g. in case of scaling or if another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is
applied.

The C<setsar> filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for
the filter output video.

Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the
output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation
above.

Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the C<setsar>
filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if
another "setsar" or a "setdar" filter is applied.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<r, ratio, dar (C<setdar> only), sar (C<setsar> only)>

Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.

The parameter can be a floating point number string, an expression, or
a string of the form I<num>:I<den>, where I<num> and
I<den> are the numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. If
the parameter is not specified, it is assumed the value "0".
In case the form "I<num>:I<den>" is used, the C<:> character
should be escaped.


=item B<max>

Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and
denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational.
Default value is C<100>.


=back


The parameter I<sar> is an expression containing

=head2 ssim


Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two input videos.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the SSIM.

Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.

=item B<stats_file, f>

If specified the filter will use the named file to save the SSIM of
each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to
standard output.

reference file F<ref_movie.mpg>. The SSIM of each individual frame
is stored in F<stats.log>.


=item *

Another example with both psnr and ssim at same time:
	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi  "ssim;[0:v][1:v]psnr" -f null -

=head2 threshold


Apply threshold effect to video stream.

This filter needs four video streams to perform thresholding.
First stream is stream we are filtering.
Second stream is holding threshold values, third stream is holding min values,
and last, fourth stream is holding max values.

The filter accepts the following option:


=over 4


=item B<planes>

Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

=back


For example if first stream pixel's component value is less then threshold value
of pixel component from 2nd threshold stream, third stream value will picked,
otherwise fourth stream pixel component value will be picked.

Using color source filter one can perform various types of thresholding:


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
	
	ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=black -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi



=item *

Inverted binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
	
	ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -f lavfi -i color=black -lavfi threshold output.avi



=item *

Truncate binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
	
	ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -lavfi threshold output.avi



=item *

Threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:
	
	ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -i 320x240.avi -lavfi threshold output.avi



=item *

Inverted threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:
	
	ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi


=back



=head2 thumbnail

Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive frames.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<n>

Set the frames batch size to analyze; in a set of I<n> frames, the filter
will pick one of them, and then handle the next batch of I<n> frames until
the end. Default is C<100>.

=back


Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger I<n>
value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not recommended.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Extract one picture each 50 frames:
	
	thumbnail=50



=item *

Complete example of a thumbnail creation with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 -frames:v 1 out.png


=back




=head2 tile


Tile several successive frames together.

The B<untile> filter can do the reverse.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<layout>

Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns). For the syntax of
this option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.


=item B<nb_frames>

Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given area. It must be less
than or equal to I<w>xI<h>. The default value is C<0>, meaning all
the area will be used.


=item B<margin>

Set the outer border margin in pixels.


=item B<padding>

Set the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels between frames). For
more advanced padding options (such as having different values for the edges),
refer to the pad video filter.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the unused area. For the syntax of this option, check the
B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.
The default value of I<color> is "black".


=item B<overlap>

Set the number of frames to overlap when tiling several successive frames together.
The value must be between C<0> and I<nb_frames - 1>.


=item B<init_padding>

Set the number of frames to initially be empty before displaying first output frame.
This controls how soon will one get first output frame.
The value must be between C<0> and I<nb_frames - 1>.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Produce 8x8 PNG tiles of all keyframes (B<-skip_frame nokey>) in a movie:
	
	ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file.avi -vf 'scale=128:72,tile=8x8' -an -vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png

The B<-vsync 0> is necessary to prevent B<ffmpeg> from
duplicating each output frame to accommodate the originally detected frame
rate.


=item *

Display C<5> pictures in an area of C<3x2> frames,
with C<7> pixels between them, and C<2> pixels of initial margin, using
mixed flat and named options:
	
	tile=3x2:nb_frames=5:padding=7:margin=2


=back



=head2 tinterlace


Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.

Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is
considered odd.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<mode>

Specify the mode of the interlacing. This option can also be specified
as a value alone. See below for a list of values for this option.

Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<merge, 0>

Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field,
generating a double height frame at half frame rate.

=back


Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward
compatibility reasons.

Default mode is C<merge>.


=item B<flags>

Specify flags influencing the filter process.

Available value for I<flags> is:


=over 4


=item B<low_pass_filter, vlpf>

Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the filter.
Vertical low-pass filtering is required when creating an interlaced
destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency
vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace 'twitter' and Moire
patterning.


=item B<complex_filter, cvlpf>

Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering.
This will slightly less reduce interlace 'twitter' and Moire
patterning but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression.


=item B<bypass_il>

Bypass already interlaced frames, only adjust the frame rate.

=back


Vertical low-pass filtering and bypassing already interlaced frames can only be
enabled for B<mode> I<interleave_top> and I<interleave_bottom>.


=back



=head2 tmedian

Pick median pixels from several successive input video frames.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<radius>

Set radius of median filter.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.


=item B<planes>

Set which planes to filter. Default value is C<15>, by which all planes are processed.


=item B<percentile>

Set median percentile. Default value is C<0.5>.
Default value of C<0.5> will pick always median values, while C<0> will pick
minimum values, and C<1> maximum values.

=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports all above options as B<commands>, excluding option C<radius>.


=head2 tmidequalizer


Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.

Midway Video Equalization adjusts a sequence of video frames to have the same
histograms, while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It's
useful for e.g. matching exposures from a video frames sequence.

This filter accepts the following option:


=over 4


=item B<radius>

Set filtering radius. Default is C<5>. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.


=item B<sigma>

Set filtering sigma. Default is C<0.5>. This controls strength of filtering.
Setting this option to 0 effectively does nothing.


=item B<planes>

Set which planes to process. Default is C<15>, which is all available planes.

=back



=head2 tmix


Mix successive video frames.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<frames>

The number of successive frames to mix. If unspecified, it defaults to 3.


=item B<weights>

Specify weight of each input video frame.
Each weight is separated by space. If number of weights is smaller than
number of I<frames> last specified weight will be used for all remaining
unset weights.


=item B<scale>

Specify scale, if it is set it will be multiplied with sum
of each weight multiplied with pixel values to give final destination
pixel value. By default I<scale> is auto scaled to sum of weights.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Average 7 successive frames:
	
	tmix=frames=7:weights="1 1 1 1 1 1 1"



=item *

Apply simple temporal convolution:
	
	tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 3 -1"



=item *

Similar as above but only showing temporal differences:
	
	tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 2 -1":scale=1


=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<weights>


=item B<scale>

Syntax is same as option with same name.

=back




=head2 tonemap

Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.

This filter expects data in single precision floating point, as it needs to
operate on (and can output) out-of-range values. Another filter, such as
B<zscale>, is needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable format.

The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear light, so input
data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf zscale=transfer=linear,tonemap=clip,zscale=transfer=bt709,format=yuv420p OUTPUT



=head3 Options

The filter accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<tonemap>

Set the tone map algorithm to use.

Possible values are:

=over 4


=item I<none>

Do not apply any tone map, only desaturate overbright pixels.


=item I<clip>

Hard-clip any out-of-range values. Use it for perfect color accuracy for
in-range values, while distorting out-of-range values.


=item I<linear>

Stretch the entire reference gamut to a linear multiple of the display.


=item I<gamma>

Fit a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.


=item I<reinhard>

Preserve overall image brightness with a simple curve, using nonlinear
contrast, which results in flattening details and degrading color accuracy.


=item I<hable>

Preserve both dark and bright details better than I<reinhard>, at the cost
of slightly darkening everything. Use it when detail preservation is more
important than color and brightness accuracy.


=item I<mobius>

Smoothly map out-of-range values, while retaining contrast and colors for
in-range material as much as possible. Use it when color accuracy is more
important than detail preservation.

=back


Default is none.


=item B<param>

Tune the tone mapping algorithm.

This affects the following algorithms:

=over 4


=item I<none>

Ignored.


=item I<linear>

Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching.
Default to 1.0.


=item I<gamma>

Specifies the exponent of the function.
Default to 1.8.


=item I<clip>

Specify an extra linear coefficient to multiply into the signal before clipping.
Default to 1.0.


=item I<reinhard>

Specify the local contrast coefficient at the display peak.
Default to 0.5, which means that in-gamut values will be about half as bright
as when clipping.


=item I<hable>

Ignored.


=item I<mobius>

Specify the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every value
below this point is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the
more accurate the result will be, at the cost of losing bright details.
Default to 0.3, which due to the steep initial slope still preserves in-range
colors fairly accurately.

=back



=item B<desat>

Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The
higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This
setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
(smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural,
at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

The default of 2.0 is somewhat conservative and will mostly just apply to
skies or directly sunlit surfaces. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

This option works only if the input frame has a supported color tag.


=item B<peak>

Override signal/nominal/reference peak with this value. Useful when the
embedded peak information in display metadata is not reliable or when tone
mapping from a lower range to a higher range.

=back



=head2 tpad

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<start>

Specify number of delay frames before input video stream. Default is 0.


=item B<stop>

Specify number of padding frames after input video stream.
Set to -1 to pad indefinitely. Default is 0.


=item B<start_mode>

Set kind of frames added to beginning of stream.
Can be either I<add> or I<clone>.
With I<add> frames of solid-color are added.
With I<clone> frames are clones of first frame.
Default is I<add>.


=item B<stop_mode>

Set kind of frames added to end of stream.
Can be either I<add> or I<clone>.
With I<add> frames of solid-color are added.
With I<clone> frames are clones of last frame.
Default is I<add>.


=item B<start_duration, stop_duration>

Specify the duration of the start/stop delay. See
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>
for the accepted syntax.
These options override I<start> and I<stop>. Default is 0.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual>.

The default value of I<color> is "black".

=back




=head2 transpose


Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<dir>

Specify the transposition direction.

Can assume the following values:

=over 4

=item B<3, 7, clock_flip>

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:
	
	L.R     r.R
	. . ->  . .
	l.r     l.L


=back


For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if the input
video geometry is portrait and not landscape. These values are
deprecated, the C<passthrough> option should be used instead.

Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in favor of
symbolic constants.


=item B<passthrough>

Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one
specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Always apply transposition.

=item B<portrait>

Preserve portrait geometry (when I<height> E<gt>= I<width>).

=item B<landscape>

Preserve landscape geometry (when I<width> E<gt>= I<height>).

=back


Default value is C<none>.

=back


For example to rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and preserve portrait
layout:
	
	transpose=dir=1:passthrough=portrait


The command above can also be specified as:
	
	transpose=1:portrait



=head2 transpose_npp

=item B<landscape>

Preserve landscape geometry (when I<width> E<gt>= I<height>).

=back



=back



=head2 trim

Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the
timestamp I<start> will be the first frame in the output.


=item B<end>

Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame
immediately preceding the one with the timestamp I<end> will be the last
frame in the output.


=item B<start_pts>

This is the same as I<start>, except this option sets the start timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.


=item B<end_pts>

This is the same as I<end>, except this option sets the end timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.


=item B<duration>

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.


=item B<start_frame>

The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.


=item B<end_frame>

The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

=back


B<start>, B<end>, and B<duration> are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>
for the accepted syntax.

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the B<duration>
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the
frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify
the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
setpts filter after the trim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

=over 4


=item *

Drop everything except the second minute of input:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120



=item *

Keep only the first second:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1



=back



=head2 unpremultiply

=over 4


=item B<planes>

Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

If the format has 1 or 2 components, then luma is bit 0.
If the format has 3 or 4 components:
for RGB formats bit 0 is green, bit 1 is blue and bit 2 is red;
for YUV formats bit 0 is luma, bit 1 is chroma-U and bit 2 is chroma-V.
If present, the alpha channel is always the last bit.


=item B<inplace>

Do not require 2nd input for processing, instead use alpha plane from input stream.

=back




=head2 unsharp

and 23. The default value is 5.


=item B<luma_amount, la>

Set the luma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable
values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

Default value is 1.0.


=item B<chroma_msize_x, cx>

Set the chroma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer
between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.

multiplied by the number of tiles.

This filter does the reverse of B<tile>.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<layout>

Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns). For the syntax of
this option, check the

=over 4


=item *

Produce a 1-second video from a still image file made of 25 frames stacked
vertically, like an analogic film reel:

=back



=head2 uspp


Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses
the image at several (or - in the case of B<quality> level C<8> - all)
shifts and average the results.

The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra only 8x8
DCT similar to MJPEG.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<quality>

Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 0-8. If set to C<0>, the filter will have no
effect. A value of C<8> means the higher quality. For each increment of
that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is
C<3>.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports subset of above options as B<commands>.


=head2 vaguedenoiser


Apply a wavelet based denoiser.

It transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain,
using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to
the obtained coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after.
Due to wavelet properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and
reduced noise, without blurring picture features.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<threshold>

The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be.
Hard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding
before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<hard>

All values under the threshold will be zeroed.


=item B<soft>

All values under the threshold will be zeroed. All values above will be
reduced by the threshold.


=item B<garrote>

Scales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary between (more) soft and
(less) hard thresholding.

=back


Default is garrote.


=item B<nsteps>

Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture. Picture can't
be decomposed beyond a particular point (typically, 8 for a 640x480
frame - as 2^9 = 512 E<gt> 480). Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.


=item B<percent>

Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.


=item B<planes>

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<universal>

=over 4


=item B<mode, m>

Set vectorscope mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<gray>


=item B<tint>

Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness means more pixels have
same component color value on location in graph. This is the default mode.


=item B<color>

Gray values are displayed on graph. Surrounding pixels values which are not
present in video frame are drawn in gradient of 2 color components which are
set by option C<x> and C<y>. The 3rd color component is static.


=item B<color2>

Actual color components values present in video frame are displayed on graph.


=item B<color3>

Similar as color2 but higher frequency of same values C<x> and C<y>
on graph increases value of another color component, which is luminance by
default values of C<x> and C<y>.


=item B<color4>

Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on graph. If two different
colors map to same position on graph then color with higher value of component
not present in graph is picked.


=item B<color5>

Gray values are displayed on graph. Similar to C<color> but with 3rd color
component picked from radial gradient.

=back



=item B<x>

Set which color component will be represented on X-axis. Default is C<1>.


=item B<y>

Set which color component will be represented on Y-axis. Default is C<2>.

is 0.1 * 255 = 25.


=item B<hthreshold, h>

Set high threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis.
Values higher than this value will be ignored. Default is 1.
Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component
can have. So for 8-bit input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold
is 0.9 * 255 = 230.

=item B<result>

Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information.
Default value is F<transforms.trf>.


=item B<shakiness>

Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an
integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a
value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.


=item B<accuracy>

Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the
range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high
accuracy. Default value is 15.


=item B<stepsize>

Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is
scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.


=item B<mincontrast>

Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is
discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default
value is 0.3.


=item B<tripod>

Set reference frame number for tripod mode.

If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame
in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea
is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep
the camera view absolutely still.

If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.


=item B<show>

Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an
integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any
visualization.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Use default values:
	
	vidstabdetect



=item *

Analyze strongly shaky movie and put the results in file
F<mytransforms.trf>:
	
	vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result="mytransforms.trf"



=item *

Visualize the result of internal transformations in the resulting
video:
	
	vidstabdetect=show=1



=item *

=back




=head2 vidstabtransform


Video stabilization/deshaking: pass 2 of 2,
see B<vidstabdetect> for pass 1.

Read a file with transform information for each frame and
apply/compensate them. Together with the B<vidstabdetect>
filter this can be used to deshake videos. See also
E<lt>B<http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab>E<gt>. It is important to also use
the B<unsharp> filter, see below.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-libvidstab>.

camera movements. Default value is 10.

For example a number of 10 means that 21 frames are used (10 in the
past and 10 in the future) to smoothen the motion in the video. A
larger value leads to a smoother video, but limits the acceleration of
the camera (pan/tilt movements). 0 is a special case where a static
camera is simulated.

=item B<relative>

Consider transforms as relative to previous frame if set to 1,
absolute if set to 0. Default value is 0.


=item B<zoom>

Set percentage to zoom. A positive value will result in a zoom-in
effect, a negative value in a zoom-out effect. Default value is 0 (no
zoom).


=item B<optzoom>

Set optimal zooming to avoid borders.

Accepted values are:

=over 4


=item B<0>

disabled

=item B<1>

optimal static zoom value is determined (only very strong movements
will lead to visible borders) (default)

=item B<2>

optimal adaptive zoom value is determined (no borders will be
visible), see B<zoomspeed>

=back


Note that the value given at zoom is added to the one calculated here.


=item B<zoomspeed>

Set percent to zoom maximally each frame (enabled when
B<optzoom> is set to 2). Range is from 0 to 5, default value is
0.25.

C<relative=0:smoothing=0>. Default value is 0.

Use also C<tripod> option of B<vidstabdetect>.


=item B<debug>

Increase log verbosity if set to 1. Also the detected global motions
are written to the temporary file F<global_motions.trf>. Default
value is 0.

=item *

Use B<ffmpeg> for a typical stabilization with default values:
	
	ffmpeg -i inp.mpeg -vf vidstabtransform,unsharp=5:5:0.8:3:3:0.4 inp_stabilized.mpeg


Note the use of the B<unsharp> filter which is always recommended.


=item *

Zoom in a bit more and load transform data from a given file:
	
	vidstabtransform=zoom=5:input="mytransforms.trf"



=item *

Smoothen the video even more:
	
	vidstabtransform=smoothing=30


=back



=head2 vflip


Flip the input video vertically.

For example, to vertically flip a video with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "vflip" out.avi



=head2 vfrdet


Detect variable frame rate video.

This filter tries to detect if the input is variable or constant frame rate.

At end it will output number of frames detected as having variable delta pts,
and ones with constant delta pts.

otherwise colors will be less saturated, more towards gray.

=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports the all above options as B<commands>.


=head2 vif


Obtain the average VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained average VIF score is printed through the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated VIF score of each frame.

In the below example the input file F<main.mpg> being processed is compared
with the reference file F<ref.mpg>.

	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi vif -f null -




=head2 vignette

Available modes are:

=over 4


=item B<forward>

The larger the distance from the central point, the darker the image becomes.


=item B<backward>

The larger the distance from the central point, the brighter the image becomes.
This can be used to reverse a vignette effect, though there is no automatic
detection to extract the lens B<angle> and other settings (yet). It can
also be used to create a burning effect.

=back


Default value is B<forward>.


=item B<eval>

Set evaluation mode for the expressions (B<angle>, B<x0>, B<y0>).

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<init>

Evaluate expressions only once during the filter initialization.


=item B<frame>

Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. This is way slower than the
B<init> mode since it requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it
allows advanced dynamic expressions.

=back


Default value is B<init>.


=item B<dither>

Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is C<1>
(enabled).


=item B<aspect>

Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette.
Setting this value to the SAR of the input will make a rectangular vignetting
following the dimensions of the video.

Default is C<1/1>.

=back



=head3 Expressions

It is one of the component metrics of VMAF.

The obtained average motion score is printed through the logging system.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<stats_file>

If specified, the filter will use the named file to save the motion score of
each frame with respect to the previous frame.
When filename equals "-" the data is sent to standard output.

=back


Example:
	
	ffmpeg -i ref.mpg -vf vmafmotion -f null -



=head2 vstack

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.

=back



=head2 w3fdif


Deinterlace the input video ("w3fdif" stands for "Weston 3 Field
Deinterlacing Filter").

Based on the process described by Martin Weston for BBC R&D, and
implemented based on the de-interlace algorithm written by Jim
Easterbrook for BBC R&D, the Weston 3 field deinterlacing filter
uses filter coefficients calculated by BBC R&D.

This filter uses field-dominance information in frame to decide which
of each pair of fields to place first in the output.
If it gets it wrong use B<setfield> filter before C<w3fdif> filter.

There are two sets of filter coefficients, so called "simple"
and "complex". Which set of filter coefficients is used can
be set by passing an optional parameter:


=over 4


=item B<filter>

Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<simple>

Simple filter coefficient set.

=item B<complex>

More-complex filter coefficient set.

=back

Default value is B<complex>.


=item B<mode>

=over 4


=item B<frame>

Output one frame for each frame.

=item B<field>

Output one frame for each field.

=back


The default value is C<field>.


=item B<parity>

of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<tff>

Assume the top field is first.

=item B<bff>

Assume the bottom field is first.

=item B<auto>

Enable automatic detection of field parity.

=back


The default value is C<auto>.
If the interlacing is unknown or the decoder does not export this information,
top field first will be assumed.


=item B<deint>

Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<all>

Deinterlace all frames,

=item B<interlaced>

Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

=back


Default value is B<all>.

=back



=head3 Commands

This filter supports same B<commands> as options.


=head2 waveform

Video waveform monitor.

The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By default luminance
only. Each column of the waveform corresponds to a column of pixels in the
source video.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode, m>

Can be either C<row>, or C<column>. Default is C<column>.
In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color component value 0 and
the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top side represents
color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.


=item B<intensity, i>

Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how many values of the same
luminance are distributed across input rows/columns.
Default value is C<0.04>. Allowed range is [0, 1].


=item B<mirror, r>

Set mirroring mode. C<0> means unmirrored, C<1> means mirrored.
In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left
side for C<row> mode and at the top for C<column> mode. Default is
C<1> (mirrored).


=item B<display, d>

Set display mode.
It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<overlay>

Presents information identical to that in the C<parade>, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences or similarities
in overlapping areas of the color components that are supposed to be identical,
such as neutral whites, grays, or blacks.


=item B<stack>

Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
C<row> mode or one below the other in C<column> mode.


=item B<parade>

Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
C<column> mode or one below the other in C<row> mode.

Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights
and shadows of an image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom
graphs of each waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized
by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the picture
should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the
correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms.

=back

Default is C<stack>.


=item B<components, c>

Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which means only luminance
or red color component if input is in RGB colorspace. If is set for example to
7 it will display all 3 (if) available color components.


=item B<envelope, e>


=over 4


=item B<none>

No envelope, this is default.


=item B<instant>

Instant envelope, minimum and maximum values presented in graph will be easily
visible even with small C<step> value.


=item B<peak>

Hold minimum and maximum values presented in graph across time. This way you
can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at waveforms.

All streams must be of same pixel format.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<inputs>

Set number of input streams. Default is 2.


=item B<layout>

Specify layout of inputs.
This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the user.
This sets position of each video input in output. Each input
is separated by '|'.
The first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row.
Numbers start at 0 and are separated by '_'. Optionally one can use wX and hX,
where X is video input from which to take width or height.
Multiple values can be used when separated by '+'. In such
case values are summed together.

Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of
the output video frame will be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each
other if their position doesn't leave enough space for the full frame of
adjoining videos.

For 2 inputs, a default layout of C<0_0|w0_0> is set. In all other cases,
a layout must be set by the user.


=item B<shortest>

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.


=item B<fill>

If set to valid color, all unused pixels will be filled with that color.

=head2 zscale

Scale (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library:
E<lt>B<https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg>E<gt>. To enable compilation of this
filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-libzimg>.

The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
as the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

If the input image format is different from the format requested by
the next filter, the zscale filter will convert the input to the
requested format.


=head3 Options

The filter accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input
dimension.

If the I<width> or I<w> value is 0, the input width is used for
the output. If the I<height> or I<h> value is 0, the input height
is used for the output.

If one and only one of the values is -n with n E<gt>= 1, the zscale filter
will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image,
calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will,
however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and
adjust the value if necessary.

If both values are -n with n E<gt>= 1, the behavior will be identical to
both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.

See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension
expression.

=head1 OPENCL VIDEO FILTERS


Below is a description of the currently available OpenCL video filters.

To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-opencl>.

Running OpenCL filters requires you to initialize a hardware device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter graph.

=over 4



=item B<-init_hw_device opencl[=>I<name>B<][:>I<device>B<[,>I<key=value>B<...]]>

Initialise a new hardware device of type I<opencl> called I<name>, using the
given device parameters.


=item B<-filter_hw_device> I<name>

Pass the hardware device called I<name> to all filters in any filter graph.


=back


For more detailed information see E<lt>B<https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options>E<gt>


=over 4


=item *

Example of choosing the first device on the second platform and running avgblur_opencl filter with default parameters on it.
	
	-init_hw_device opencl=gpu:1.0 -filter_hw_device gpu -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl, hwdownload" OUTPUT


=back


Since OpenCL filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded(B<hwupload>) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded(B<hwdownload>) back to normal memory. Note that B<hwupload> will upload to a surface with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a B<format> filter immediately before to get the input into the right format and B<hwdownload> does not support all formats on the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional B<format> filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.


=head2 avgblur_opencl


Apply average blur filter.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sizeX>

Set horizontal radius size.
Range is C<[1, 1024]> and default value is C<1>.


=item B<planes>

Set which planes to filter. Default value is C<0xf>, by which all planes are processed.


=item B<sizeY>

Set vertical radius size. Range is C<[1, 1024]> and default value is C<0>. If zero, C<sizeX> value will be used.

=back



=head3 Example



=over 4


=item *

Apply average blur filter with horizontal and vertical size of 3, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of the 7x7 region centered on it in the input. For pixels on the edges of the image, the region does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.
	
	-i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl=3, hwdownload" OUTPUT


=back



=head2 boxblur_opencl


Apply a boxblur algorithm to the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<luma_radius, lr>


=item B<luma_power, lp>


=item B<chroma_radius, cr>


=item B<chroma_power, cp>


=item B<alpha_radius, ar>


=item B<alpha_power, ap>



=back


A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<luma_radius, lr>


=item B<chroma_radius, cr>


=item B<alpha_radius, ar>

Set an expression for the box radius in pixels used for blurring the
corresponding input plane.

The radius value must be a non-negative number, and must not be
greater than the value of the expression C<min(w,h)/2> for the
luma and alpha planes, and of C<min(cw,ch)/2> for the chroma
planes.

Default value for B<luma_radius> is "2". If not specified,
B<chroma_radius> and B<alpha_radius> default to the
corresponding value set for B<luma_radius>.

The expressions can contain the following constants:

=over 4


=item B<w>


=item B<h>

The input width and height in pixels.


=item B<cw>


=item B<ch>

The input chroma image width and height in pixels.


=item B<hsub>


=item B<vsub>

The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the
pixel format "yuv422p", I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.

=back



=item B<luma_power, lp>


=item B<chroma_power, cp>


=item B<alpha_power, ap>

Specify how many times the boxblur filter is applied to the
corresponding plane.

Default value for B<luma_power> is 2. If not specified,
B<chroma_power> and B<alpha_power> default to the
corresponding value set for B<luma_power>.

A value of 0 will disable the effect.

=back



=head3 Examples


Apply boxblur filter, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of box-radiuses I<luma_radius>, I<chroma_radius>, I<alpha_radius> for each plane respectively. The filter will apply I<luma_power>, I<chroma_power>, I<alpha_power> times onto the corresponding plane. For pixels on the edges of the image, the radius does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.


=over 4


=item *

Apply a boxblur filter with the luma, chroma, and alpha radius
set to 2 and luma, chroma, and alpha power set to 3. The filter will run 3 times with box-radius set to 2 for every plane of the image.

Whether or not feature points should be refined at a sub-pixel level.

This can be turned off for a slight performance gain at the cost of precision.

Defaults to C<1>.


=item B<smooth_strength>

The strength of the smoothing applied to the camera path from C<0.0> to C<1.0>.

C<1.0> is the maximum smoothing strength while values less than that result in less smoothing.

C<0.0> causes the filter to adaptively choose a smoothing strength on a per-frame basis.

Defaults to C<0.0>.


=item B<smooth_window_multiplier>

Controls the size of the smoothing window (the number of frames buffered to determine motion information from).

The size of the smoothing window is determined by multiplying the framerate of the video by this number.

Acceptable values range from C<0.1> to C<10.0>.

Larger values increase the amount of motion data available for determining how to smooth the camera path,
potentially improving smoothness, but also increase latency and memory usage.

Defaults to C<2.0>.

=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Stabilize a video with a fixed, medium smoothing strength:
	
	-i INPUT -vf "hwupload, deshake_opencl=smooth_strength=0.5, hwdownload" OUTPUT

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Specify an expression for the size of the output image with the
paddings added. If the value for I<width> or I<height> is 0, the
corresponding input size is used for the output.

The I<width> expression can reference the value set by the
I<height> expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<width> and I<height> is 0.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Specify the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area,
with respect to the top/left border of the output image.

The I<x> expression can reference the value set by the I<y>
expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<x> and I<y> is 0.

If I<x> or I<y> evaluate to a negative number, they'll be changed
so the input image is centered on the padded area.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual>.

=head2 program_opencl


Filter video using an OpenCL program.


=over 4



=item B<source>

OpenCL program source file.


=item B<kernel>

Kernel name in program.


=item B<inputs>

Number of inputs to the filter.  Defaults to 1.


=item B<size, s>

Size of output frames.  Defaults to the same as the first input.


=back


The C<program_opencl> filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

The program source file must contain a kernel function with the given name,
which will be run once for each plane of the output.  Each run on a plane
gets enqueued as a separate 2D global NDRange with one work-item for each
pixel to be generated.  The global ID offset for each work-item is therefore
the coordinates of a pixel in the destination image.

The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:

=over 4


=item *

Destination image, I<__write_only image2d_t>.

This image will become the output; the kernel should write all of it.

=item *

Frame index, I<unsigned int>.

This is a counter starting from zero and increasing by one for each frame.

=item *

Source images, I<__read_only image2d_t>.

These are the most recent images on each input.  The kernel may read from
them to generate the output, but they can't be written to.

=back


Example programs:


=over 4


=item *

Copy the input to the output (output must be the same size as the input).
	
	__kernel void copy(__write_only image2d_t destination,

	    write_imagef(destination, location, value);
	}



=item *

Apply a simple transformation, rotating the input by an amount increasing
with the index counter.  Pixel values are linearly interpolated by the
sampler, and the output need not have the same dimensions as the input.
	
	__kernel void rotate_image(__write_only image2d_t dst,
	                           unsigned int index,

	        sin(angle) * dst_pos.x + cos(angle) * dst_pos.y
	    };
	    src_pos = src_pos * src_dim / dst_dim;
	
	    float2 src_loc = src_pos + src_cen;
	
	    if (src_loc.x < 0.0f      || src_loc.y < 0.0f ||
	        src_loc.x > src_dim.x || src_loc.y > src_dim.y)
	        write_imagef(dst, dst_loc, 0.5f);
	    else
	        write_imagef(dst, dst_loc, read_imagef(src, sampler, src_loc));
	}



=item *

Blend two inputs together, with the amount of each input used varying

=item B<param>

Tune the tone mapping algorithm. same as param option in B<tonemap>.


=item B<desat>

Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The
higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This
setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
(smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural,
at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

The default value is 0.5, and the algorithm here is a little different from
the cpu version tonemap currently. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.


=item B<threshold>

The tonemapping algorithm parameters is fine-tuned per each scene. And a threshold
is used to detect whether the scene has changed or not. If the distance between
the current frame average brightness and the current running average exceeds
a threshold value, we would re-calculate scene average and peak brightness.

=head1 VAAPI VIDEO FILTERS


VAAPI Video filters are usually used with VAAPI decoder and VAAPI encoder. Below is a description of VAAPI video filters.

To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-vaapi>.

To use vaapi filters, you need to setup the vaapi device correctly. For more information, please read E<lt>B<https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI>E<gt>


=head2 tonemap_vaapi

=head1 VIDEO SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available video sources.


=head2 buffer


Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in F<libavfilter/buffersrc.h>.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<video_size>

Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the
syntax of this option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.


=item B<width>

The input video width.


=item B<height>

The input video height.


=item B<pix_fmt>

A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
name.


=item B<time_base>

Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.


=item B<frame_rate>

Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.


=item B<pixel_aspect, sar>

The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.


=item B<sws_param>

This option is deprecated and ignored. Prepend C<sws_flags=I<flags>;>
to the filtergraph description to specify swscale flags for automatically
inserted scalers. See B<Filtergraph syntax>.


=item B<hw_frames_ctx>

When using a hardware pixel format, this should be a reference to an
AVHWFramesContext describing input frames.

=back


For example:
	
	buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1


will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format "yuv410p", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name "yuv410p" corresponds to the number 6
(check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in F<libavutil/pixfmt.h>),
this example corresponds to:
	
	buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1


Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this
syntax is deprecated:

I<width>:I<height>:I<pix_fmt>:I<time_base.num>:I<time_base.den>:I<pixel_aspect.num>:I<pixel_aspect.den>


=head2 cellauto


Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the
B<filename> and B<pattern> options. If such options are
not specified an initial state is created randomly.

At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of
the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole
frame is filled is defined by the B<scroll> option.

This source accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from
the specified file.
In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive
cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
file will be ignored.


=item B<pattern, p>

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from

=head2 life


Generate a life pattern.

This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.

The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The B<rule> option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.

This source accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.

If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.


=item B<rate, r>

Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.


=item B<random_fill_ratio, ratio>

Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.


=item B<random_seed, seed>

Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.


=item B<rule>

Set the life rule.

A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "SI<NS>/BI<NB>",
where I<NS> and I<NB> are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8,
I<NS> specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and I<NB> the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born").
"s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B", respectively.

Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = C<(12E<lt>E<lt>9)+9> specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".

Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway's game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.


=item B<size, s>

Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.

If B<filename> is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If B<size> is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.

If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x240"
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).


=item B<stitch>

If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.


=item B<mold>

Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from B<death_color> to
B<mold_color> with a step of B<mold>. B<mold> can have a
value from 0 to 255.


=item B<life_color>

Set the color of living (or new born) cells.


=item B<death_color>

Set the color of dead cells. If B<mold> is set, this is the first color
used to represent a dead cell.


=item B<mold_color>

Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the B<"Color" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual>.

=head2 avectorscope


Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio vector
scope.

The filter is used to measure the difference between channels of stereo
audio stream. A monaural signal, consisting of identical left and right
signal, results in straight vertical line. Any stereo separation is visible
as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure.
If the straight (or deviation from it) but horizontal line appears this
indicates that the left and right channels are out of phase.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode, m>

Set the vectorscope mode.

Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<lissajous>

Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Get the current time, set it as frame metadata (using the key
C<lavfi.bench.start_time>), and forward the frame to the next filter.


=item B<stop>

=head2 concat


Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the
other.

The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All
segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will
also be the number of streams at output.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<n>

Set the number of segments. Default is 2.


=item B<v>

Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video
streams in each segment. Default is 1.


=item B<a>

Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of audio
streams in each segment. Default is 0.


=item B<unsafe>

Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.


=back


The filter has I<v>+I<a> outputs: first I<v> video outputs, then
I<a> audio outputs.

There are I<n>x(I<v>+I<a>) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.

Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.

For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.

All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the
filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video
streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for
audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
explicitly by the user.

Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate
at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual version
(video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2):
	
	ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
	  '[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
	   concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]' \
	  -map '[v]' -map '[a1]' -map '[a2]' output.mkv



=item *

Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using the
(a)movie sources, and adjusting the resolution:
	
	movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
	movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
	[v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]

Note that a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video streams
do not have exactly the same duration in the first file.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<next>

=back




=head2 ebur128


EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream and analyzes its loudness
level. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of 10Hz with the
Momentary loudness (identified by C<M>), Short-term loudness (C<S>),
Integrated loudness (C<I>) and Loudness Range (C<LRA>).

The filter can only analyze streams which have a sampling rate of 48000 Hz and whose
sample format is double-precision floating point. The input stream will be converted to
this specification, if needed. Users may need to insert aformat and/or aresample filters
after this filter to obtain the original parameters.

The filter also has a video output (see the I<video> option) with a real
time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged
message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the
short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for
the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured
to instead display short-term loudness (see I<gauge>).

The green area marks a  +/- 1LU target range around the target loudness
(-23LUFS by default, unless modified through I<target>).

More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on
E<lt>B<http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness>E<gt>.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<video>

Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged whether this
option is set or no. The video stream will be the first output stream if
activated. Default is C<0>.


=item B<size>

Set the video size. This option is for video only. For the syntax of this
option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.
Default and minimum resolution is C<640x480>.


=item B<meter>

Set the EBU scale meter. Default is C<9>. Common values are C<9> and
C<18>, respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any
other integer value between this range is allowed.


=item B<metadata>

Set metadata injection. If set to C<1>, the audio input will be segmented
into 100ms output frames, each of them containing various loudness information
in metadata.  All the metadata keys are prefixed with C<lavfi.r128.>.

Default is C<0>.


=item B<framelog>

Force the frame logging level.

Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<info>

information logging level

=item B<verbose>

verbose logging level

=back


By default, the logging level is set to I<info>. If the B<video> or
the B<metadata> options are set, it switches to I<verbose>.


=item B<peak>

Set peak mode(s).

Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a C<flag> type). Possible
values are:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Disable any peak mode (default).

=item B<sample>

Enable sample-peak mode.

Simple peak mode looking for the higher sample value. It logs a message
for sample-peak (identified by C<SPK>).

=item B<true>

Enable true-peak mode.

If enabled, the peak lookup is done on an over-sampled version of the input
stream for better peak accuracy. It logs a message for true-peak.
(identified by C<TPK>) and true-peak per frame (identified by C<FTPK>).
This mode requires a build with C<libswresample>.

=back



=item B<dualmono>

Treat mono input files as "dual mono". If a mono file is intended for playback
on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect.
If set to C<true>, this option will compensate for this effect.
Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.


=item B<panlaw>

Set a specific pan law to be used for the measurement of dual mono files.
This parameter is optional, and has a default value of -3.01dB.


=item B<target>

Set a specific target level (in LUFS) used as relative zero in the visualization.
This parameter is optional and has a default value of -23LUFS as specified
by EBU R128. However, material published online may prefer a level of -16LUFS
(e.g. for use with podcasts or video platforms).


=item B<gauge>

Set the value displayed by the gauge. Valid values are C<momentary> and s
C<shortterm>. By default the momentary value will be used, but in certain
scenarios it may be more useful to observe the short term value instead (e.g.
live mixing).


=item B<scale>

Sets the display scale for the loudness. Valid parameters are C<absolute>
(in LUFS) or C<relative> (LU) relative to the target. This only affects the
video output, not the summary or continuous log output.

=head2 interleave, ainterleave


Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

C<interleave> works with video inputs, C<ainterleave> with audio.

These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.

Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.

In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.

For example consider the case when one input is a C<select> filter
which always drops input frames. The C<interleave> filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.

Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

These filters accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<nb_inputs, n>

Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.


=item B<duration>

How to determine the end-of-stream.


=over 4


=item B<longest>

=head2 perms, aperms


Set read/write permissions for the output frames.

These filters are mainly aimed at developers to test direct path in the
following filter in the filtergraph.

The filters accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode>

Select the permissions mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do nothing. This is the default.

=item B<ro>

Set all the output frames read-only.

=item B<rw>

Set all the output frames directly writable.

C<0> and C<UINT32_MAX>. If not specified, or if explicitly set to
C<-1>, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort
basis.

=back


Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission filter and the
following one, the permission might not be received as expected in that
following filter. Inserting a B<format> or B<aformat> filter before the
perms/aperms filter can avoid this problem.


=head2 realtime, arealtime


Slow down filtering to match real time approximately.

These filters will pause the filtering for a variable amount of time to
match the output rate with the input timestamps.
They are similar to the B<re> option to C<ffmpeg>.

They accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<limit>

Time limit for the pauses. Any pause longer than that will be considered
a timestamp discontinuity and reset the timer. Default is 2 seconds.

=item B<speed>

Speed factor for processing. The value must be a float larger than zero.
Values larger than 1.0 will result in faster than realtime processing,
smaller will slow processing down. The I<limit> is automatically adapted
accordingly. Default is 1.0.

A processing speed faster than what is possible without these filters cannot
be achieved.

=back




=head2 select, aselect


Select frames to pass in output.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<expr, e>

Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame.

If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded.

If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the
first output; otherwise it is sent to the output with index
C<ceil(val)-1>, assuming that the input index starts from 0.

For example a value of C<1.2> corresponds to the output with index
C<ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1>, that is the second output.


=item B<outputs, n>

Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected
frame is based on the result of the evaluation. Default value is 1.

=back


The expression can contain the following constants:


=over 4

=item B<prev_selected_pts>

The PTS of the last previously filtered video frame. It's NAN if undefined.


=item B<prev_selected_t>

=item B<B>


=item B<S>


=item B<SI>


=item B<SP>

The frame is top-field-first.

=item B<BOTTOMFIRST>

The frame is bottom-field-first.

=back



=item B<consumed_sample_n> I<(audio only)>

=item B<samples_n> I<(audio only)>

the number of samples in the current frame


=item B<sample_rate> I<(audio only)>

the input sample rate


=item B<key>

This is 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise.


=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the information
is not available (e.g. for synthetic video)


=item B<scene> I<(video only)>

value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low
probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher
value means the current frame is more likely to be one (see the example below)


=item B<concatdec_select>

The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input file by setting an
inpoint and an outpoint, but the output packets may not be entirely contained
in the selected interval. By using this variable, it is possible to skip frames
generated by the concat demuxer which are not exactly contained in the selected
interval.

This works by comparing the frame pts against the I<lavf.concat.start_time>
and the I<lavf.concat.duration> packet metadata values which are also
present in the decoded frames.

The I<concatdec_select> variable is -1 if the frame pts is at least
start_time and either the duration metadata is missing or the frame pts is less
than start_time + duration, 0 otherwise, and NaN if the start_time metadata is
missing.

That basically means that an input frame is selected if its pts is within the
interval set by the concat demuxer.


=back


The default value of the select expression is "1".

choice.

=head2 sendcmd, asendcmd


Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.

These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the
filtergraph.

C<sendcmd> must be inserted between two video filters,
C<asendcmd> must be inserted between two audio filters, but apart
from that they act the same way.

The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments
with the I<commands> option, or in a file specified by the
I<filename> option.

These filters accept the following options:

=item B<filename, f>

Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other
filters.

=head3 Commands syntax


A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
interval.

An interval is specified by the following syntax:
	
	<START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>;


The time interval is specified by the I<START> and I<END> times.
I<END> is optional and defaults to the maximum time.

The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
it is included in the interval [I<START>, I<END>), that is when
the time is greater or equal to I<START> and is lesser than
I<END>.

I<COMMANDS> consists of a sequence of one or more command
specifications, separated by ",", relating to that interval.  The
syntax of a command specification is given by:
	
	[<FLAGS>] <TARGET> <COMMAND> <ARG>


I<FLAGS> is optional and specifies the type of events relating to
the time interval which enable sending the specified command, and must
be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by "+" or "|" and
enclosed between "[" and "]".

The following flags are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<enter>

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
current is.


=item B<leave>

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the
current is not.


=item B<expr>

The command I<ARG> is interpreted as expression and result of
expression is passed as I<ARG>.

The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following
constants:


=over 4


=item B<POS>

Original position in the file of the frame, or undefined if undefined
for the current frame.


=item B<PTS>

The presentation timestamp in input.


=item B<N>

The count of the input frame for video or audio, starting from 0.


=item B<T>

The time in seconds of the current frame.


=item B<TS>

The start time in seconds of the current command interval.


=item B<TE>

The end time in seconds of the current command interval.


=item B<TI>

The interpolated time of the current command interval, TI = (T - TS) / (TE - TS).

=back



=back


If I<FLAGS> is not specified, a default value of C<[enter]> is
assumed.

I<TARGET> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.

I<COMMAND> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

I<ARG> is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for
the given I<COMMAND>.

Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or
sequences of characters starting with C<#> until the end of line,
are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.

A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax
follows:
	
	<COMMAND_FLAG>  ::= "enter" | "leave"
	<COMMAND_FLAGS> ::= <COMMAND_FLAG> [(+|"|")<COMMAND_FLAG>]
	<COMMAND>       ::= ["[" <COMMAND_FLAGS> "]"] <TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]
	<COMMANDS>      ::= <COMMAND> [,<COMMANDS>]
	<INTERVAL>      ::= <START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>
	<INTERVALS>     ::= <INTERVAL>[;<INTERVALS>]

=back



=head2 spectrumsynth


Synthesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents
magnitude across time and second represents phase across time.
The filter will transform from frequency domain as displayed in videos back
to time domain as presented in audio output.

This filter is primarily created for reversing processed B<showspectrum>
filter outputs, but can synthesize sound from other spectrograms too.
But in such case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not
available, because in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually
it's just recreated from random noise.
For best results use gray only output (C<channel> color mode in
B<showspectrum> filter) and C<log> scale for magnitude video and
C<lin> scale for phase video. To produce phase, for 2nd video, use
C<data> option. Inputs videos should generally use C<fullframe>
slide mode as that saves resources needed for decoding video.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sample_rate>

Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which
spectrum was generated may differ.


=item B<channels>

Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.

Set window overlap. In range C<[0, 1]>. Default is C<1>,
which means optimal overlap for selected window function will be picked.


=item B<orientation>

Set orientation of input videos. Can be C<vertical> or C<horizontal>.
Default is C<vertical>.

=back



=head3 Examples

=back



=head2 split, asplit


Split input into several identical outputs.

C<asplit> works with audio input, C<split> with video.

The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of outputs. If
unspecified, it defaults to 2.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Create two separate outputs from the same input:
	
	[in] split [out0][out1]



=item *

To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of
outputs, like in:
	
	[in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]



=item *

Create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and
one padded:
	
	[in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
	[splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
	[splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];



=item *

Create 5 copies of the input audio with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT


=back



=head2 zmq, azmq


Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to
filters in the filtergraph.

C<zmq> and C<azmq> work as a pass-through filters. C<zmq>
must be inserted between two video filters, C<azmq> between two
audio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any filter type.

To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and
headers and configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-libzmq>.

For more information about libzmq see:
E<lt>B<http://www.zeromq.org/>E<gt>

The C<zmq> and C<azmq> filters work as a libzmq server, which
receives messages sent through a network interface defined by the
B<bind_address> (or the abbreviation "B<b>") option.
Default value of this option is F<tcp://localhost:5555>. You may
want to alter this value to your needs, but do not forget to escape any
':' signs (see B<filtergraph escaping>).

The received message must be in the form:
	
	<TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]


I<TARGET> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name. The default
filter instance name uses the pattern B<Parsed_E<lt>filter_nameE<gt>_E<lt>indexE<gt>>,
but you can override this by using the B<filter_name@id> syntax
(see B<Filtergraph syntax>).

I<COMMAND> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

I<ARG> is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the
given I<COMMAND>.

Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command
is injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter
will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:
	
	<ERROR_CODE> <ERROR_REASON>
	<MESSAGE>


I<MESSAGE> is optional.


=head3 Examples


Look at F<tools/zmqsend> for an example of a zmq client which can
be used to send commands processed by these filters.

Consider the following filtergraph generated by B<ffplay>.
In this example the last overlay filter has an instance name. All other
filters will have default instance names.

	
	ffplay -dumpgraph 1 -f lavfi "
	color=s=100x100:c=red  [l];
	color=s=100x100:c=blue [r];
	nullsrc=s=200x100, zmq [bg];
	[bg][l]   overlay     [bg+l];
	[bg+l][r] overlay@my=x=100 "


To change the color of the left side of the video, the following
command can be used:
	
	echo Parsed_color_0 c yellow | tools/zmqsend


To change the right side:
	
	echo Parsed_color_1 c pink | tools/zmqsend


To change the position of the right side:
	
	echo overlay@my x 150 | tools/zmqsend





=head1 MULTIMEDIA SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.


=head2 amovie


This is the same as B<movie> source, except it selects an audio
stream by default.



=head2 movie


Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<filename>

The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a
device or a stream accessed through some protocol).


=item B<format_name, f>

Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the
format is guessed from I<movie_name> or by probing.


=item B<seek_point, sp>

Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output
starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with
C<av_strtod>, so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS
postfix. The default value is "0".


=item B<streams, s>

Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
separated by "+". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
same order. The syntax is explained in the B<"Stream specifiers"
section in the ffmpeg manual>. Two special names, "dv" and "da" specify
respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default
is "dv", or "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".


=item B<stream_index, si>

Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1,
the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default
value is "-1". Deprecated. If the filter is called "amovie", it will select
audio instead of video.


=item B<loop>

Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.
If the value is 0, the stream will be looped infinitely.
Default value is "1".

Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.


=item B<discontinuity>

Specifies the time difference between frames above which the point is
considered a timestamp discontinuity which is removed by adjusting the later
timestamps.

=back


It allows overlaying a second video on top of the main input of
a filtergraph, as shown in this graph:
	
	input -----------> deltapts0 --> overlay --> output
	                                    ^
	                                    |
	movie --> scale--> deltapts1 -------+

=back



=head3 Commands


Both movie and amovie support the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<seek>

Perform seek using "av_seek_frame".
The syntax is: seek I<stream_index>|I<timestamp>|I<flags>

=over 4


=item *

stream is selected, and I<timestamp> is automatically converted
from AV_TIME_BASE units to the stream specific time_base.

=item *

I<timestamp>: Timestamp in AVStream.time_base units
or, if no stream is specified, in AV_TIME_BASE units.

=item *

I<flags>: Flags which select direction and seeking mode.

=back



=item B<get_duration>

Get movie duration in AV_TIME_BASE units.


=back



=head1 EXTERNAL LIBRARIES


FFmpeg can be hooked up with a number of external libraries to add support
for more formats. None of them are used by default, their use has to be
explicitly requested by passing the appropriate flags to
B<./configure>.


=head2 Alliance for Open Media (AOM)


FFmpeg can make use of the AOM library for AV1 decoding and encoding.

Go to E<lt>B<http://aomedia.org/>E<gt> and follow the instructions for
installing the library. Then pass C<--enable-libaom> to configure to
enable it.


=head2 AMD AMF/VCE


FFmpeg can use the AMD Advanced Media Framework library
for accelerated H.264 and HEVC(only windows) encoding on hardware with Video Coding Engine (VCE).

To enable support you must obtain the AMF framework header files(version 1.4.9+) from
E<lt>B<https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF.git>E<gt>.

Create an C<AMF/> directory in the system include path.
Copy the contents of C<AMF/amf/public/include/> into that directory.
Then configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-amf>.

Initialization of amf encoder occurs in this order:
1) trying to initialize through dx11(only windows)
2) trying to initialize through dx9(only windows)
3) trying to initialize through vulkan

To use h.264(AMD VCE) encoder on linux amdgru-pro version 19.20+ and amf-amdgpu-pro
package(amdgru-pro contains, but does not install automatically) are required.

This driver can be installed using amdgpu-pro-install script in official amd driver archive.


=head2 AviSynth


FFmpeg can read AviSynth scripts as input. To enable support, pass
C<--enable-avisynth> to configure after installing the headers
provided by E<lt>B<https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus>E<gt>.
AviSynth+ can be configured to install only the headers by either
passing C<-DHEADERS_ONLY:bool=on> to the normal CMake-based build
system, or by using the supplied C<GNUmakefile>.

For Windows, supported AviSynth variants are
E<lt>B<http://avisynth.nl>E<gt> for 32-bit builds and
E<lt>B<http://avisynth.nl/index.php/AviSynth+>E<gt> for 32-bit and 64-bit builds.

For Linux, macOS, and BSD, the only supported AviSynth variant is
E<lt>B<https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus>E<gt>, starting with version 3.5.


=over 4

In 2016, AviSynth+ added support for building with GCC. However, due to
the eccentricities of Windows' calling conventions, 32-bit GCC builds
of AviSynth+ are not compatible with typical 32-bit builds of FFmpeg.

By default, FFmpeg assumes compatibility with 32-bit MSVC builds of
AviSynth+ since that is the most widely-used and entrenched build
configuration.  Users can override this and enable support for 32-bit
GCC builds of AviSynth+ by passing C<-DAVSC_WIN32_GCC32> to
C<--extra-cflags> when configuring FFmpeg.

64-bit builds of FFmpeg are not affected, and can use either MSVC or
GCC builds of AviSynth+ without any special flags.

=back



=over 4

AviSynth(+) is loaded dynamically.  Distributors can build FFmpeg
with C<--enable-avisynth>, and the binaries will work regardless
of the end user having AviSynth installed.  If/when an end user
would like to use AviSynth scripts, then they can install AviSynth(+)
and FFmpeg will be able to find and use it to open scripts.

=back



=head2 Chromaprint


FFmpeg can make use of the Chromaprint library for generating audio fingerprints.
Pass C<--enable-chromaprint> to configure to
enable it. See E<lt>B<https://acoustid.org/chromaprint>E<gt>.


=head2 codec2


FFmpeg can make use of the codec2 library for codec2 decoding and encoding.
There is currently no native decoder, so libcodec2 must be used for decoding.

Go to E<lt>B<http://freedv.org/>E<gt>, download "Codec 2 source archive".
Build and install using CMake. Debian users can install the libcodec2-dev package instead.
Once libcodec2 is installed you can pass C<--enable-libcodec2> to configure to enable it.

The easiest way to use codec2 is with .c2 files, since they contain the mode information required for decoding.
To encode such a file, use a .c2 file extension and give the libcodec2 encoder the -mode option:
C<ffmpeg -i input.wav -mode 700C output.c2>.
Playback is as simple as C<ffplay output.c2>.
For a list of supported modes, run C<ffmpeg -h encoder=libcodec2>.
Raw codec2 files are also supported.
To make sense of them the mode in use needs to be specified as a format option:
C<ffmpeg -f codec2raw -mode 1300 -i input.raw output.wav>.


=head2 dav1d


FFmpeg can make use of the dav1d library for AV1 video decoding.

Go to E<lt>B<https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d>E<gt> and follow the instructions for
