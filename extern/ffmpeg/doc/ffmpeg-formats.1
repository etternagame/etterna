.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes the supported formats (muxers and demuxers)
provided by the libavformat library.
.SH "FORMAT OPTIONS"
.IX Header "FORMAT OPTIONS"
The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the muxers and demuxers. In addition each muxer or
demuxer may support so-called private options, which are specific for
that component.
.PP
Options may be set by specifying \-\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AVFormatContext\*(C'\fR options or using the \fIlibavutil/opt.h\fR \s-1API\s0
for programmatic use.
.PP
The list of supported options follows:

.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBmax_interleave_delta\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "max_interleave_delta integer (output)"
Set maximum buffering duration for interleaving. The duration is
expressed in microseconds, and defaults to 10000000 (10 seconds).
.Sp
To ensure all the streams are interleaved correctly, libavformat will
wait until it has at least one packet for each stream before actually
writing any packets to the output file. When some streams are
\&\*(L"sparse\*(R" (i.e. there are large gaps between successive packets), this
can result in excessive buffering.
.Sp
This field specifies the maximum difference between the timestamps of the
first and the last packet in the muxing queue, above which libavformat
will output a packet regardless of whether it has queued a packet for all
the streams.
.Sp
If set to 0, libavformat will continue buffering packets until it has
a packet for each stream, regardless of the maximum timestamp
difference between the buffered packets.
.IP "\fBuse_wallclock_as_timestamps\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_wallclock_as_timestamps integer (input)"
Use wallclock as timestamps if set to 1. Default is 0.
.IP "\fBavoid_negative_ts\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "avoid_negative_ts integer (output)"
Possible values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBmake_non_negative\fR" 4
.IX Item "make_non_negative"
Shift timestamps to make them non-negative.
Also note that this affects only leading negative timestamps, and not
non-monotonic negative timestamps.
.IP "\fBmake_zero\fR" 4
.IX Item "make_zero"
Shift timestamps so that the first timestamp is 0.
.IP "\fBauto (default)\fR" 4
.IX Item "auto (default)"
Enables shifting when required by the target format.
.IP "\fBdisabled\fR" 4
.IX Item "disabled"
Disables shifting of timestamp.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
When shifting is enabled, all output timestamps are shifted by the
same amount. Audio, video, and subtitles desynching and relative
timestamp differences are preserved compared to how they would have
been without shifting.
.RE
.IP "\fBskip_initial_bytes\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "skip_initial_bytes integer (input)"
Set number of bytes to skip before reading header and frames if set to 1.
Default is 0.
.IP "\fBcorrect_ts_overflow\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "correct_ts_overflow integer (input)"
Correct single timestamp overflows if set to 1. Default is 1.
.IP "\fBflush_packets\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "flush_packets integer (output)"
Flush the underlying I/O stream after each packet. Default is \-1 (auto), which
means that the underlying protocol will decide, 1 enables it, and has the
effect of reducing the latency, 0 disables it and may increase \s-1IO\s0 throughput in
some cases.
.IP "\fBoutput_ts_offset\fR \fIoffset\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "output_ts_offset offset (output)"
Set the output time offset.
.Sp
\&\fIoffset\fR must be a time duration specification,
see \fBthe Time duration section in the \fBffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR.
.Sp
The offset is added by the muxer to the output timestamps.
.Sp
Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are
delayed bt the time duration specified in \fIoffset\fR. Default value
is \f(CW0\fR (meaning that no offset is applied).
.IP "\fBformat_whitelist\fR \fIlist\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "format_whitelist list (input)"
\&\*(L",\*(R" separated list of allowed demuxers. By default all are allowed.
.IP "\fBdump_separator\fR \fIstring\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump_separator string (input)"
Separator used to separate the fields printed on the command line about the
Stream parameters.
For example, to separate the fields with newlines and indentation:
.Sp
.Vb 2

.Ve
.IP "\fBmax_streams\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "max_streams integer (input)"
Specifies the maximum number of streams. This can be used to reject files that
would require too many resources due to a large number of streams.
.IP "\fBskip_estimate_duration_from_pts\fR \fIbool\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "skip_estimate_duration_from_pts bool (input)"
Skip estimation of input duration when calculated using \s-1PTS.\s0
At present, applicable for MPEG-PS and MPEG-TS.
.IP "\fBstrict, f_strict\fR \fIinteger\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput/output\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "strict, f_strict integer (input/output)"
Specify how strictly to follow the standards. \f(CW\*(C`f_strict\*(C'\fR is deprecated and
should be used only via the \fBffmpeg\fR tool.
.Sp
Possible values:

.SH "DEMUXERS"
.IX Header "DEMUXERS"
Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg that can read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.
.PP
When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-list\-demuxers\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-demuxers\*(C'\fR, and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-demuxer=\f(CIDEMUXER\f(CW\*(C'\fR, or disable it
with the option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-demuxer=\f(CIDEMUXER\f(CW\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The option \f(CW\*(C`\-demuxers\*(C'\fR of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers. Use \f(CW\*(C`\-formats\*(C'\fR to view a combined list of
enabled demuxers and muxers.
.PP
The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.
.SS "aa"
.IX Subsection "aa"
Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 (.aa) files.
.SS "apng"
.IX Subsection "apng"
Animated Portable Network Graphics demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux \s-1APNG\s0 files.
All headers, but the \s-1PNG\s0 signature, up to (but not including) the first
fcTL chunk are transmitted as extradata.
Frames are then split as being all the chunks between two fcTL ones, or
between the last fcTL and \s-1IEND\s0 chunks.
.IP "\fB\-ignore_loop\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ignore_loop bool"
Ignore the loop variable in the file if set.
.IP "\fB\-max_fps\fR \fIint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-max_fps int"
Maximum framerate in frames per second (0 for no limit).
.IP "\fB\-default_fps\fR \fIint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-default_fps int"
Default framerate in frames per second when none is specified in the file
(0 meaning as fast as possible).
.SS "asf"
.IX Subsection "asf"
Advanced Systems Format demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux \s-1ASF\s0 files and \s-1MMS\s0 network streams.
.IP "\fB\-no_resync_search\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_resync_search bool"
Do not try to resynchronize by looking for a certain optional start code.
.SS "concat"
.IX Subsection "concat"
Virtual concatenation script demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packets had been muxed
together.
.PP
The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.
.PP
All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).
.PP
The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.
.PP
\fISyntax\fR
.IX Subsection "Syntax"
.PP
The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
following directive is recognized:
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""file \f(CBpath\f(CB""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBfile \f(CBpath\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "file path"
Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.
.Sp
All subsequent file-related directives apply to that file.
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""ffconcat version 1.0""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBffconcat version 1.0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ffconcat version 1.0"
Identify the script type and version. It also sets the \fBsafe\fR option
to 1 if it was \-1.
.Sp
To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appear exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first
line of the script.
.ie n .IP "\fB\f(CB""duration \f(CBdur\f(CB""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBduration \f(CBdur\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "duration dur"
Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.
.Sp
If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the

.IX Item "inpoint timestamp"
In point of the file. When the demuxer opens the file it instantly seeks to the
specified timestamp. Seeking is done so that all streams can be presented
successfully at In point.
.Sp
This directive works best with intra frame codecs, because for non-intra frame
ones you will usually get extra packets before the actual In point and the
decoded content will most likely contain frames before In point too.
.Sp
For each file, packets before the file In point will have timestamps less than
the calculated start timestamp of the file (negative in case of the first
file), and the duration of the files (if not specified by the \f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR
directive) will be reduced based on their specified In point.
.Sp
Because of potential packets before the specified In point, packet timestamps
may overlap between two concatenated files.

.IX Item "outpoint timestamp"
Out point of the file. When the demuxer reaches the specified decoding
timestamp in any of the streams, it handles it as an end of file condition and
skips the current and all the remaining packets from all streams.
.Sp
Out point is exclusive, which means that the demuxer will not output packets
with a decoding timestamp greater or equal to Out point.
.Sp
This directive works best with intra frame codecs and formats where all streams
are tightly interleaved. For non-intra frame codecs you will usually get
additional packets with presentation timestamp after Out point therefore the
decoded content will most likely contain frames after Out point too. If your
streams are not tightly interleaved you may not get all the packets from all
streams before Out point and you may only will be able to decode the earliest
stream until Out point.
.Sp
The duration of the files (if not specified by the \f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR
directive) will be reduced based on their specified Out point.

\&\s-1GIF\s0 files can contain information to loop a certain number of times (or
infinitely). If \fBignore_loop\fR is set to 1, then the loop setting
from the input will be ignored and looping will not occur. If set to 0,

.PP
The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.
.PP
The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.
.PP
This demuxer accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBframerate\fR" 4
.IX Item "framerate"
Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.
.IP "\fBloop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop"
If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.
.IP "\fBpattern_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "pattern_type"
Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.
.Sp
\&\fIpattern_type\fR accepts one of the following values.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBnone\fR" 4
.IX Item "none"
Disable pattern matching, therefore the video will only contain the specified
image. You should use this option if you do not want to create sequences from
multiple images and your filenames may contain special pattern characters.
.IP "\fBsequence\fR" 4
.IX Item "sequence"
Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.
.Sp
A sequence pattern may contain the string \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd\*(L", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
\&\*(R"%d0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0\-padded and \fIN\fR is the total number of 0\-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string \*(L"%%\*(R".
.Sp
If the sequence pattern contains \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between \fIstart_number\fR and
\&\fIstart_number\fR+\fIstart_number_range\fR\-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.
.Sp
For example the pattern \*(L"img\-%03d.bmp\*(R" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.; the pattern \*(L"i%%m%%g\-%d.jpg\*(R" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form \fIi%m%g\-1.jpg\fR,
\&\fIi%m%g\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIi%m%g\-10.jpg\fR, etc.
.Sp
Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain \*(L"%d\*(R" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to convert a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR you can employ the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i img.jpeg img.png
.Ve
.IP "\fBglob\fR" 4
.IX Item "glob"
Select a glob wildcard pattern type.
.Sp
The pattern is interpreted like a \f(CW\*(C`glob()\*(C'\fR pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.
.IP "\fBglob_sequence\fR \fI(deprecated, will be removed)\fR" 4
.IX Item "glob_sequence (deprecated, will be removed)"
Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.
.Sp
If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
\&\f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR that is preceded by an unescaped \*(L"%\*(R", the pattern is
interpreted like a \f(CW\*(C`glob()\*(C'\fR pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.
.Sp
All glob special characters \f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR must be prefixed
with \*(L"%\*(R". To escape a literal \*(L"%\*(R" you shall use \*(L"%%\*(R".
.Sp
For example the pattern \f(CW\*(C`foo\-%*.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the
filenames prefixed by \*(L"foo\-\*(R" and terminating with \*(L".jpeg\*(R", and
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo\-%?%?%?.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the filenames prefixed with
\&\*(L"foo\-\*(R", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with \*(L".jpeg\*(R".
.Sp
This pattern type is deprecated in favor of \fIglob\fR and
\&\fIsequence\fR.

Raw video demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there is no header
specifying the assumed video parameters, the user must specify them
in order to be able to decode the data correctly.

SBaGen script demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
<\fBhttp://uazu.net/sbagen/\fR> to generate binaural beats sessions. A \s-1SBG\s0
script looks like that:
.PP
.Vb 9

\&        +0:21:00 == b
\&        +0:30:00    off
.Ve
.PP
A \s-1SBG\s0 script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the \fI\s-1NOW\s0\fR reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.

It accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBreserve_index_space\fR" 4
.IX Item "reserve_index_space"
Reserve the specified amount of bytes for the OpenDML master index of each
stream within the file header. By default additional master indexes are
embedded within the data packets if there is no space left in the first master
index and are linked together as a chain of indexes. This index structure can
cause problems for some use cases, e.g. third-party software strictly relying
on the OpenDML index specification or when file seeking is slow. Reserving
enough index space in the file header avoids these problems.
.Sp
The required index space depends on the output file size and should be about 16
bytes per gigabyte. When this option is omitted or set to zero the necessary
index space is guessed.

It accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBloop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop"
Set the number of times to loop the output. Use \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR for no loop, \f(CW0\fR
for looping indefinitely (default).
.IP "\fBfinal_delay\fR" 4
.IX Item "final_delay"
Force the delay (expressed in centiseconds) after the last frame. Each frame
ends with a delay until the next frame. The default is \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR, which is a
special value to tell the muxer to re-use the previous delay. In case of a
loop, you might want to customize this value to mark a pause for instance.
.PP
For example, to encode a gif looping 10 times, with a 5 seconds delay between
the loops:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-loop 10 \-final_delay 500 out.gif

Note 2: the \s-1GIF\s0 format has a very large time base: the delay between two frames
can therefore not be smaller than one centi second.
.SS "hash"
.IX Subsection "hash"
Hash testing format.
.PP
This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash of all the input
audio and video frames. This can be used for equality checks without

key \s-1URL\s0 is used to access the encryption key during playback. The second line
specifies the path to the key file used to obtain the key during the encryption
process. The key file is read as a single packed array of 16 octets in binary
format. The optional third line specifies the initialization vector (\s-1IV\s0) as a
hexadecimal string to be used instead of the segment sequence number (default)
for encryption. Changes to \fIkey_info_file\fR will result in segment
encryption with the new key/IV and an entry in the playlist for the new key
\&\s-1URI/IV\s0 if \f(CW\*(C`hls_flags periodic_rekey\*(C'\fR is enabled.

.SS "image2"
.IX Subsection "image2"
Image file muxer.
.PP
The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.
.PP
The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
produce sequentially numbered series of files.
The pattern may contain the string \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd\*(L", this string
specifies the position of the characters representing a numbering in
the filenames. If the form \*(R"%0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string
representing the number in each filename is 0\-padded to \fIN\fR
digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the pattern with
the string \*(L"%%\*(R".
.PP
If the pattern contains \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified will contain the number 1, all the following
numbers will be sequential.
.PP
The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the image files to write.
.PP
For example the pattern \*(L"img\-%03d.bmp\*(R" will specify a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.
The pattern \*(L"img%%\-%d.jpg\*(R" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
form \fIimg%\-1.jpg\fR, \fIimg%\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIimg%\-10.jpg\fR,
etc.
.PP
The image muxer supports the .Y.U.V image file format. This format is
special in that that each image frame consists of three files, for
each of the \s-1YUV420P\s0 components. To read or write this image file format,
specify the name of the '.Y' file. The muxer will automatically open the
\&'.U' and '.V' files as required.

.PP
The following example shows how to use \fBffmpeg\fR for creating a
sequence of files \fIimg\-001.jpeg\fR, \fIimg\-002.jpeg\fR, ...,
taking one image every second from the input video:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-vsync cfr \-r 1 \-f image2 \*(Aqimg\-%03d.jpeg\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note that with \fBffmpeg\fR, if the format is not specified with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR option and the output filename specifies an image file
format, the image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous
command can be written as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-vsync cfr \-r 1 \*(Aqimg\-%03d.jpeg\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain \*(L"%d\*(R" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to create a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR from the start of the input video you can employ the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-f image2 \-frames:v 1 img.jpeg
.Ve
.PP
The \fBstrftime\fR option allows you to expand the filename with
date and time information. Check the documentation of
the \f(CW\*(C`strftime()\*(C'\fR function for the syntax.
.PP
For example to generate image files from the \f(CW\*(C`strftime()\*(C'\fR
\&\*(L"%Y\-%m\-%d_%H\-%M\-%S\*(R" pattern, the following \fBffmpeg\fR command
can be used:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f v4l2 \-r 1 \-i /dev/video0 \-f image2 \-strftime 1 "%Y\-%m\-%d_%H\-%M\-%S.jpg"
.Ve
.PP
You can set the file name with current frame's \s-1PTS:\s0

.PP
This muxer supports the following options:
.IP "\fBreserve_index_space\fR" 4
.IX Item "reserve_index_space"
By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska
terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space
to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases
\&\*(-- e.g.  streaming where seeking is possible but slow \*(-- it is useful to put the
index at the beginning of the file.
.Sp
If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve a given amount
of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing
finishes. If the reserved space does not suffice, no Cues will be written, the
file will be finalized and writing the trailer will return an error.
A safe size for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.
.Sp
Note that cues are only written if the output is seekable and this option will
have no effect if it is not.
.IP "\fBdefault_mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "default_mode"

It influences which tracks players should play by default. The default mode

.RS 4
.IP "\fBinfer\fR" 4
.IX Item "infer"
In this mode, for each type of track (audio, video or subtitle), if there is
a track with disposition default of this type, then the first such track
(i.e. the one with the lowest index) will be marked as default; if no such
track exists, the first track of this type will be marked as default instead
(if existing). This ensures that the default flag is set in a sensible way even
if the input originated from containers that lack the concept of default tracks.
.IP "\fBinfer_no_subs\fR" 4
.IX Item "infer_no_subs"
This mode is the same as infer except that if no subtitle track with
disposition default exists, no subtitle track will be marked as default.
.IP "\fBpassthrough\fR" 4

\&\s-1MOV/MP4/ISMV\s0 (Smooth Streaming) muxer.
.PP
The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a \s-1MOV/MP4\s0
file has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location
(written at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for
better playback by adding \fIfaststart\fR to the \fImovflags\fR, or
using the \fBqt-faststart\fR tool). A fragmented
file consists of a number of fragments, where packets and metadata
about these packets are stored together. Writing a fragmented
file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if the
writing is interrupted (while a normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 is undecodable if
it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
very long files (since writing normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 files stores info about
every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
is that it is less compatible with other applications.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR

Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define
how to cut the file into fragments:
.IP "\fB\-moov_size\fR \fIbytes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-moov_size bytes"
Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file instead of placing the
moov atom at the end. If the space reserved is insufficient, muxing will fail.
.IP "\fB\-movflags frag_keyframe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags frag_keyframe"
Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.
.IP "\fB\-frag_duration\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frag_duration duration"
Create fragments that are \fIduration\fR microseconds long.
.IP "\fB\-frag_size\fR \fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frag_size size"
Create fragments that contain up to \fIsize\fR bytes of payload data.
.IP "\fB\-movflags frag_custom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags frag_custom"
Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by
calling \f(CW\*(C`av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)\*(C'\fR to write a fragment with
the packets written so far. (This is only useful with other
applications integrating libavformat, not from \fBffmpeg\fR.)
.IP "\fB\-min_frag_duration\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-min_frag_duration duration"
Don't create fragments that are shorter than \fIduration\fR microseconds long.
.PP
If more than one condition is specified, fragments are cut when
one of the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-min_frag_duration\*(C'\fR, which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
conditions to apply.
.PP
Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted
through a few other options:
.IP "\fB\-movflags empty_moov\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags empty_moov"
Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
at the start of the file, as a normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 file, containing only
a short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has
a zero duration.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP "\fB\-movflags separate_moof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags separate_moof"
Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat
pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP "\fB\-movflags skip_sidx\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags skip_sidx"
Skip writing of sidx atom. When bitrate overhead due to sidx atom is high,
this option could be used for cases where sidx atom is not mandatory.
When global_sidx flag is enabled, this option will be ignored.
.IP "\fB\-movflags faststart\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags faststart"
Run a second pass moving the index (moov atom) to the beginning of the file.
This operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations such
as fragmented output, thus it is not enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-movflags rtphint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags rtphint"
Add \s-1RTP\s0 hinting tracks to the output file.
.IP "\fB\-movflags disable_chpl\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags disable_chpl"
Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom).  Normally, both Nero chapters
and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option
set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can
cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like
mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.
.IP "\fB\-movflags omit_tfhd_offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags omit_tfhd_offset"
Do not write any absolute base_data_offset in tfhd atoms. This avoids
tying fragments to absolute byte positions in the file/streams.
.IP "\fB\-movflags default_base_moof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags default_base_moof"
Similarly to the omit_tfhd_offset, this flag avoids writing the
absolute base_data_offset field in tfhd atoms, but does so by using
the new default-base-is-moof flag instead. This flag is new from
14496\-12:2012. This may make the fragments easier to parse in certain
circumstances (avoiding basing track fragment location calculations
on the implicit end of the previous track fragment).
.IP "\fB\-write_tmcd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-write_tmcd"
Specify \f(CW\*(C`on\*(C'\fR to force writing a timecode track, \f(CW\*(C`off\*(C'\fR to disable it
and \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR to write a timecode track only for mov and mp4 output (default).
.IP "\fB\-movflags negative_cts_offsets\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags negative_cts_offsets"
Enables utilization of version 1 of the \s-1CTTS\s0 box, in which the \s-1CTS\s0 offsets can
be negative. This enables the initial sample to have \s-1DTS/CTS\s0 of zero, and
reduces the need for edit lists for some cases such as video tracks with
B\-frames. Additionally, eases conformance with the DASH-IF interoperability
guidelines.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP "\fB\-write_prft\fR" 4
.IX Item "-write_prft"
Write producer time reference box (\s-1PRFT\s0) with a specified time source for the
\&\s-1NTP\s0 field in the \s-1PRFT\s0 box. Set value as \fBwallclock\fR to specify timesource
as wallclock time and \fBpts\fR to specify timesource as input packets' \s-1PTS\s0
values.
.Sp
Setting value to \fBpts\fR is applicable only for a live encoding use case,
where \s-1PTS\s0 values are set as as wallclock time at the source. For example, an

The \s-1MP3\s0 muxer writes a raw \s-1MP3\s0 stream with the following optional features:
.IP "\(bu" 4
An ID3v2 metadata header at the beginning (enabled by default). Versions 2.3 and
2.4 are supported, the \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR private option controls which one is
used (3 or 4). Setting \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR to 0 disables the ID3v2 header
completely.
.Sp
The muxer supports writing attached pictures (\s-1APIC\s0 frames) to the ID3v2 header.
The pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single
packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a
single \s-1APIC\s0 frame.  The stream metadata tags \fItitle\fR and \fIcomment\fR map
to \s-1APIC\s0 \fIdescription\fR and \fIpicture type\fR respectively. See
<\fBhttp://id3.org/id3v2.4.0\-frames\fR> for allowed picture types.
.Sp
Note that the \s-1APIC\s0 frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will
buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised
to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A Xing/LAME frame right after the ID3v2 header (if present). It is enabled by
default, but will be written only if the output is seekable. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`write_xing\*(C'\fR private option can be used to disable it.  The frame contains
various information that may be useful to the decoder, like the audio duration
or encoder delay.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A legacy ID3v1 tag at the end of the file (disabled by default). It may be
enabled with the \f(CW\*(C`write_id3v1\*(C'\fR private option, but as its capabilities are

Preferred page duration, in microseconds. The muxer will attempt to create
pages that are approximately \fIduration\fR microseconds long. This allows the
user to compromise between seek granularity and container overhead. The default
is 1 second. A value of 0 will fill all segments, making pages as large as
possible. A value of 1 will effectively use 1 packet-per-page in most
situations, giving a small seek granularity at the cost of additional container
overhead.

This muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of nearly

similar to \fBimage2\fR, or by using a \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR template if
the \fBstrftime\fR option is enabled.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`stream_segment\*(C'\fR is a variant of the muxer used to write to
streaming output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers,
and is recommended for outputting e.g. to \s-1MPEG\s0 transport stream segments.
\&\f(CW\*(C`ssegment\*(C'\fR is a shorter alias for \f(CW\*(C`stream_segment\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Every segment starts with a keyframe of the selected reference stream,
which is set through the \fBreference_stream\fR option.
.PP
Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file, you need to
make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting times
expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the new
segment with the key frame found next after the specified start
time.
.PP
The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.
.PP
Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting
the option \fIsegment_list\fR. The list type is specified by the

.SS "streamhash"
.IX Subsection "streamhash"
Per stream hash testing format.
.PP
This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash of all the input frames,
on a per-stream basis. This can be used for equality checks without having
to do a complete binary comparison.
.PP
By default audio frames are converted to signed 16\-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. Timestamps
are ignored. It uses the \s-1SHA\-256\s0 cryptographic hash function by default,
but supports several other algorithms.
.PP
The output of the muxer consists of one line per stream of the form:
\&\fIstreamindex\fR,\fIstreamtype\fR,\fIalgo\fR=\fIhash\fR, where
\&\fIstreamindex\fR is the index of the mapped stream, \fIstreamtype\fR is a
single character indicating the type of stream, \fIalgo\fR is a short string
representing the hash function used, and \fIhash\fR is a hexadecimal number
representing the computed hash.
.IP "\fBhash\fR \fIalgorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "hash algorithm"
Use the cryptographic hash function specified by the string \fIalgorithm\fR.
Supported values include \f(CW\*(C`MD5\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`murmur3\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RIPEMD128\*(C'\fR,

.SS "fifo"
.IX Subsection "fifo"
The fifo pseudo-muxer allows the separation of encoding and muxing by using
first-in-first-out queue and running the actual muxer in a separate thread. This
is especially useful in combination with the \fBtee\fR muxer and can be used to
send data to several destinations with different reliability/writing speed/latency.
.PP
\&\s-1API\s0 users should be aware that callback functions (interrupt_callback,
io_open and io_close) used within its AVFormatContext must be thread-safe.
.PP
The behavior of the fifo muxer if the queue fills up or if the output fails is
selectable,
.IP "\(bu" 4
output can be transparently restarted with configurable delay between retries
based on real time or time of the processed stream.
.IP "\(bu" 4
encoding can be blocked during temporary failure, or continue transparently
dropping packets in case fifo queue fills up.
.IP "\fBfifo_format\fR" 4
.IX Item "fifo_format"

output name suffix.
.IP "\fBqueue_size\fR" 4

Specify size of the queue (number of packets). Default value is 60.
.IP "\fBformat_opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "format_opts"
Specify format options for the underlying muxer. Muxer options can be specified
as a list of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs separated by ':'.
.IP "\fBdrop_pkts_on_overflow\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "drop_pkts_on_overflow bool"
If set to 1 (true), in case the fifo queue fills up, packets will be dropped
rather than blocking the encoder. This makes it possible to continue streaming without
delaying the input, at the cost of omitting part of the stream. By default
this option is set to 0 (false), so in such cases the encoder will be blocked
until the muxer processes some of the packets and none of them is lost.
.IP "\fBattempt_recovery\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "attempt_recovery bool"
If failure occurs, attempt to recover the output. This is especially useful
when used with network output, since it makes it possible to restart streaming transparently.
By default this option is set to 0 (false).
.IP "\fBmax_recovery_attempts\fR" 4
.IX Item "max_recovery_attempts"
Sets maximum number of successive unsuccessful recovery attempts after which
the output fails permanently. By default this option is set to 0 (unlimited).
.IP "\fBrecovery_wait_time\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "recovery_wait_time duration"
Waiting time before the next recovery attempt after previous unsuccessful
recovery attempt. Default value is 5 seconds.
.IP "\fBrecovery_wait_streamtime\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "recovery_wait_streamtime bool"
If set to 0 (false), the real time is used when waiting for the recovery
attempt (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least
recovery_wait_time seconds).
If set to 1 (true), the time of the processed stream is taken into account
instead (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least \fIrecovery_wait_time\fR
seconds of the stream is omitted).
By default, this option is set to 0 (false).
.IP "\fBrecover_any_error\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "recover_any_error bool"
If set to 1 (true), recovery will be attempted regardless of type of the error
causing the failure. By default this option is set to 0 (false) and in case of
certain (usually permanent) errors the recovery is not attempted even when
\&\fIattempt_recovery\fR is set to 1.
.IP "\fBrestart_with_keyframe\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "restart_with_keyframe bool"
Specify whether to wait for the keyframe after recovering from

.SS "tee"
.IX Subsection "tee"
The tee muxer can be used to write the same data to several outputs, such as files or streams.
It can be used, for example, to stream a video over a network and save it to disk at the same time.
.PP
It is different from specifying several outputs to the \fBffmpeg\fR
command-line tool. With the tee muxer, the audio and video data will be encoded only once.
With conventional multiple outputs, multiple encoding operations in parallel are initiated,
which can be a very expensive process. The tee muxer is not useful when using the libavformat \s-1API\s0
directly because it is then possible to feed the same packets to several muxers directly.
.PP
Since the tee muxer does not represent any particular output format, ffmpeg cannot auto-select
output streams. So all streams intended for output must be specified using \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR. See
the examples below.
.PP
Some encoders may need different options depending on the output format;
the auto-detection of this can not work with the tee muxer, so they need to be explicitly specified.
The main example is the \fBglobal_header\fR flag.
.PP
The slave outputs are specified in the file name given to the muxer,
separated by '|'. If any of the slave name contains the '|' separator,
leading or trailing spaces or any special character, those must be
escaped (see \fBthe \*(L"Quoting and escaping\*(R"
section in the \fBffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR).
.PP
\fIOptions\fR

.IP "\fBuse_fifo\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_fifo bool"
If set to 1, slave outputs will be processed in separate threads using the \fBfifo\fR
muxer. This allows to compensate for different speed/latency/reliability of
outputs and setup transparent recovery. By default this feature is turned off.
.IP "\fBfifo_options\fR" 4
.IX Item "fifo_options"
Options to pass to fifo pseudo-muxer instances. See \fBfifo\fR.
.PP
Muxer options can be specified for each slave by prepending them as a list of
\&\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs separated by ':', between square brackets. If
the options values contain a special character or the ':' separator, they
must be escaped; note that this is a second level escaping.
.PP
The following special options are also recognized:
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Specify the format name. Required if it cannot be guessed from the
output \s-1URL.\s0
.IP "\fBbsfs[/\fR\fIspec\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "bsfs[/spec]"
Specify a list of bitstream filters to apply to the specified
output.
.Sp
It is possible to specify to which streams a given bitstream filter
applies, by appending a stream specifier to the option separated by
\&\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR. \fIspec\fR must be a stream specifier (see \fBFormat
stream specifiers\fR).
.Sp
If the stream specifier is not specified, the bitstream filters will be
applied to all streams in the output. This will cause that output operation
to fail if the output contains streams to which the bitstream filter cannot
be applied e.g. \f(CW\*(C`h264_mp4toannexb\*(C'\fR being applied to an output containing an audio stream.
.Sp
Options for a bitstream filter must be specified in the form of \f(CW\*(C`opt=value\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Several bitstream filters can be specified, separated by \*(L",\*(R".
.IP "\fBuse_fifo\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_fifo bool"
This allows to override tee muxer use_fifo option for individual slave muxer.
.IP "\fBfifo_options\fR" 4

This allows to override tee muxer fifo_options for individual slave muxer.
See \fBfifo\fR.
.IP "\fBselect\fR" 4
.IX Item "select"
Select the streams that should be mapped to the slave output,
specified by a stream specifier. If not specified, this defaults to
all the mapped streams. This will cause that output operation to fail
if the output format does not accept all mapped streams.
.Sp
You may use multiple stream specifiers separated by commas (\f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR) e.g.: \f(CW\*(C`a:0,v\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fBonfail\fR" 4
.IX Item "onfail"
Specify behaviour on output failure. This can be set to either \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR (which is
default) or \f(CW\*(C`ignore\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR will cause whole process to fail in case of failure
on this slave output. \f(CW\*(C`ignore\*(C'\fR will ignore failure on this output, so other outputs
will continue without being affected.

.SH "METADATA"
.IX Header "METADATA"
FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF\-8\-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.
.PP
The file format is as follows:
.IP "1." 4
A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.
.IP "2." 4
The header is a \fB;FFMETADATA\fR string, followed by a version number (now 1).
.IP "3." 4
Metadata tags are of the form \fBkey=value\fR
.IP "4." 4
Immediately after header follows global metadata
.IP "5." 4
After global metadata there may be sections with per\-stream/per\-chapter
metadata.
.IP "6." 4
A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. \s-1STREAM\s0 or \s-1CHAPTER\s0) in
brackets (\fB[\fR, \fB]\fR) and ends with next section or end of file.
.IP "7." 4
At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form
\&\fBTIMEBASE=\fR\fInum\fR\fB/\fR\fIden\fR, where \fInum\fR and \fIden\fR are
integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in nanoseconds.
.Sp
Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
\&\fBSTART=\fR\fInum\fR, \fBEND=\fR\fInum\fR, where \fInum\fR is a positive
integer.
.IP "8." 4
Empty lines and lines starting with \fB;\fR or \fB#\fR are ignored.
.IP "9." 4
Metadata keys or values containing special characters (\fB=\fR, \fB;\fR,
\&\fB#\fR, \fB\e\fR and a newline) must be escaped with a backslash \fB\e\fR.
.IP "10." 4
Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. \fBfoo = bar\fR) is considered to be
a part of the tag (in the example above key is \fBfoo\fR , value is
 \fBbar\fR).
.PP
A ffmetadata file might look like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
