=head1 NAME

ffprobe - ffprobe media prober

=head1 SYNOPSIS


ffprobe [I<options>] [F<input_url>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION


ffprobe gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in
human- and machine-readable fashion.

For example it can be used to check the format of the container used
by a multimedia stream and the format and type of each media stream
contained in it.

If a url is specified in input, ffprobe will try to open and
probe the url content. If the url cannot be opened or recognized as
a multimedia file, a positive exit code is returned.

ffprobe may be employed both as a standalone application or in
combination with a textual filter, which may perform more
sophisticated processing, e.g. statistical processing or plotting.

Options are used to list some of the formats supported by ffprobe or
for specifying which information to display, and for setting how
ffprobe will show it.

ffprobe output is designed to be easily parsable by a textual filter,
and consists of one or more sections of a form defined by the selected
writer, which is specified by the B<print_format> option.

Sections may contain other nested sections, and are identified by a
name (which may be shared by other sections), and an unique
name. See the output of B<sections>.

Metadata tags stored in the container or in the streams are recognized
and printed in the corresponding "FORMAT", "STREAM" or "PROGRAM_STREAM"
section.



=head1 OPTIONS


All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo"
will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.



=head2 Stream specifiers

Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.

A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. C<-codec:a:1 ac3> contains the
C<a:1> stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in C<-b:a 128k> matches all audio
streams.

An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, C<-codec copy>
or C<-codec: copy> would copy all the streams without reencoding.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

=over 4


=item I<stream_index>

Matches the stream with this index. E.g. C<-threads:1 4> would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4. If I<stream_index> is used as an
additional stream specifier (see below), then it selects stream number
I<stream_index> from the matching streams. Stream numbering is based on the
order of the streams as detected by libavformat except when a program ID is
also specified. In this case it is based on the ordering of the streams in the
program.

=item I<stream_type>B<[:>I<additional_stream_specifier>B<]>

I<stream_type> is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's'
for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v' matches all video
streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video
thumbnails or cover arts. If I<additional_stream_specifier> is used, then
it matches streams which both have this type and match the
I<additional_stream_specifier>. Otherwise, it matches all streams of the
specified type.

=item B<p:>I<program_id>B<[:>I<additional_stream_specifier>B<]>

Matches streams which are in the program with the id I<program_id>. If
I<additional_stream_specifier> is used, then it matches streams which both
are part of the program and match the I<additional_stream_specifier>.


=item B<#>I<stream_id> B<or i:>I<stream_id>

Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

=item B<m:>I<key>B<[:>I<value>B<]>

Matches streams with the metadata tag I<key> having the specified value. If
I<value> is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.

=item B<u>

Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the
essential information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present.

Note that in B<ffmpeg>, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.

Show autodetected sources of the input device.
Some devices may provide system-dependent source names that cannot be autodetected.
The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.
	
	ffmpeg -sources pulse,server=192.168.0.4

=item B<-loglevel [>I<flags>B<+]>I<loglevel> B<| -v [>I<flags>B<+]>I<loglevel>

Set logging level and flags used by the library.

The optional I<flags> prefix can consist of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<repeat>

Indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed to the first line
and the "Last message repeated n times" line will be omitted.

=item B<level>

Indicates that log output should add a C<[level]> prefix to each message
line. This can be used as an alternative to log coloring, e.g. when dumping the
log to file.

=back

Flags can also be used alone by adding a '+'/'-' prefix to set/reset a single
flag without affecting other I<flags> or changing I<loglevel>. When
setting both I<flags> and I<loglevel>, a '+' separator is expected
between the last I<flags> value and before I<loglevel>.

I<loglevel> is a string or a number containing one of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<quiet, -8>

Show nothing at all; be silent.

=item B<panic, 0>

Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as
an assertion failure. This is not currently used for anything.

=item B<fatal, 8>

Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely
cannot continue.

=item B<error, 16>

Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

=item B<warning, 24>

Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly
incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

=item B<info, 32>

Show informative messages during processing. This is in addition to
warnings and errors. This is the default value.

=item B<verbose, 40>

Same as C<info>, except more verbose.

=item B<debug, 48>

Show everything, including debugging information.

=item B<trace, 56>


=back


For example to enable repeated log output, add the C<level> prefix, and set
I<loglevel> to C<verbose>:
	
	ffmpeg -loglevel repeat+level+verbose -i input output

Another example that enables repeated log output without affecting current
state of C<level> prefix flag or I<loglevel>:
	
	ffmpeg [...] -loglevel +repeat


By default the program logs to stderr. If coloring is supported by the
terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring
can be disabled setting the environment variable
B<AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR>, or can be forced setting
the environment variable B<AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR>.


=item B<-report>

Dump full command line and log output to a file named
C<I<program>-I<YYYYMMDD>-I<HHMMSS>.log> in the current
directory.
This file can be useful for bug reports.
It also implies C<-loglevel debug>.

Setting the environment variable B<FFREPORT> to any value has the
same effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence, these
options will affect the report; option values must be escaped if they
contain special characters or the options delimiter ':' (see the
``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

The following options are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<file>

set the file name to use for the report; C<%p> is expanded to the name
of the program, C<%t> is expanded to a timestamp, C<%%> is expanded
to a plain C<%>

=item B<level>

set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see C<-loglevel>).

=back


For example, to output a report to a file named F<ffreport.log>
using a log level of C<32> (alias for log level C<info>):

	
	FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output


Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will not
appear in the report.


=item B<-hide_banner>

Suppress printing banner.

All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build options
and library versions. This option can be used to suppress printing
this information.


=item B<-cpuflags flags (>I<global>B<)>

Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended
for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.
	
	ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
	ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
	ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

Possible flags for this option are:

=item B<-max_alloc> I<bytes>

Set the maximum size limit for allocating a block on the heap by ffmpeg's
family of malloc functions. Exercise B<extreme caution> when using
this option. Don't use if you do not understand the full consequence of doing so.
Default is INT_MAX.

=back



=head2 AVOptions


These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
B<-help> option. They are separated into two categories:

=over 4


=item B<generic>

These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.

=item B<private>

These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.

=back


For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an MP3 file, use the B<id3v2_version> private option of the MP3
muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3


All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier
should be attached to them:
	
	ffmpeg -i multichannel.mxf -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -map 0:a:0 -c:a:0 ac3 -b:a:0 640k -ac:a:1 2 -c:a:1 aac -b:2 128k out.mp4


In the above example, a multichannel audio stream is mapped twice for output.
The first instance is encoded with codec ac3 and bitrate 640k.
The second instance is downmixed to 2 channels and encoded with codec aac. A bitrate of 128k is specified for it using
absolute index of the output stream.

Note: the B<-nooption> syntax cannot be used for boolean
AVOptions, use B<-option 0>/B<-option 1>.

Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
removed soon.


=head2 Main options



=over 4



=item B<-f> I<format>

Force format to use.


=item B<-unit>

Show the unit of the displayed values.


=item B<-prefix>

Use SI prefixes for the displayed values.
Unless the "-byte_binary_prefix" option is used all the prefixes
are decimal.


=item B<-byte_binary_prefix>

Force the use of binary prefixes for byte values.


=item B<-sexagesimal>

Use sexagesimal format HH:MM:SS.MICROSECONDS for time values.


=item B<-pretty>

Prettify the format of the displayed values, it corresponds to the
options "-unit -prefix -byte_binary_prefix -sexagesimal".


=item B<-of, -print_format> I<writer_name>B<[=>I<writer_options>B<]>

Set the output printing format.

I<writer_name> specifies the name of the writer, and
I<writer_options> specifies the options to be passed to the writer.

For example for printing the output in JSON format, specify:
	
	-print_format json


For more details on the available output printing formats, see the
Writers section below.


=item B<-sections>

Print sections structure and section information, and exit. The output
is not meant to be parsed by a machine.


=item B<-select_streams> I<stream_specifier>

Select only the streams specified by I<stream_specifier>. This
option affects only the options related to streams
(e.g. C<show_streams>, C<show_packets>, etc.).

For example to show only audio streams, you can use the command:
	
	ffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a INPUT


To show only video packets belonging to the video stream with index 1:
	
	ffprobe -show_packets -select_streams v:1 INPUT



=item B<-show_data>

Show payload data, as a hexadecimal and ASCII dump. Coupled with
B<-show_packets>, it will dump the packets' data. Coupled with
B<-show_streams>, it will dump the codec extradata.

The dump is printed as the "data" field. It may contain newlines.


=item B<-show_data_hash> I<algorithm>

Show a hash of payload data, for packets with B<-show_packets> and for
codec extradata with B<-show_streams>.


=item B<-show_error>

Show information about the error found when trying to probe the input.

The error information is printed within a section with name "ERROR".


=item B<-show_format>

Show information about the container format of the input multimedia
stream.

All the container format information is printed within a section with
name "FORMAT".


=item B<-show_format_entry> I<name>

Like B<-show_format>, but only prints the specified entry of the
container format information, rather than all. This option may be given more
than once, then all specified entries will be shown.

This option is deprecated, use C<show_entries> instead.


=item B<-show_entries> I<section_entries>

Set list of entries to show.

Entries are specified according to the following
syntax. I<section_entries> contains a list of section entries
separated by C<:>. Each section entry is composed by a section
name (or unique name), optionally followed by a list of entries local
to that section, separated by C<,>.

If section name is specified but is followed by no C<=>, all
entries are printed to output, together with all the contained
sections. Otherwise only the entries specified in the local section
entries list are printed. In particular, if C<=> is specified but
the list of local entries is empty, then no entries will be shown for
that section.

Note that the order of specification of the local section entries is
not honored in the output, and the usual display order will be
retained.

The formal syntax is given by:
	
	<LOCAL_SECTION_ENTRIES> ::= <SECTION_ENTRY_NAME>[,<LOCAL_SECTION_ENTRIES>]
	<SECTION_ENTRY>         ::= <SECTION_NAME>[=[<LOCAL_SECTION_ENTRIES>]]
	<SECTION_ENTRIES>       ::= <SECTION_ENTRY>[:<SECTION_ENTRIES>]


For example, to show only the index and type of each stream, and the PTS
time, duration time, and stream index of the packets, you can specify
the argument:
	
	packet=pts_time,duration_time,stream_index : stream=index,codec_type


To show all the entries in the section "format", but only the codec
type in the section "stream", specify the argument:
	
	format : stream=codec_type


To show all the tags in the stream and format sections:
	
	stream_tags : format_tags


To show only the C<title> tag (if available) in the stream
sections:
	
	stream_tags=title



=item B<-show_packets>

Show information about each packet contained in the input multimedia
stream.

The information for each single packet is printed within a dedicated
section with name "PACKET".


=item B<-show_frames>

Show information about each frame and subtitle contained in the input
multimedia stream.

The information for each single frame is printed within a dedicated
section with name "FRAME" or "SUBTITLE".


=item B<-show_log> I<loglevel>

Show logging information from the decoder about each frame according to
the value set in I<loglevel>, (see C<-loglevel>). This option requires C<-show_frames>.

The information for each log message is printed within a dedicated
section with name "LOG".


=item B<-show_streams>

Show information about each media stream contained in the input
multimedia stream.

Each media stream information is printed within a dedicated section
with name "STREAM".


=item B<-show_programs>

Show information about programs and their streams contained in the input
multimedia stream.

Each media stream information is printed within a dedicated section
with name "PROGRAM_STREAM".


=item B<-show_chapters>

Show information about chapters stored in the format.

Each chapter is printed within a dedicated section with name "CHAPTER".


=item B<-count_frames>

Count the number of frames per stream and report it in the
corresponding stream section.


=item B<-count_packets>

Count the number of packets per stream and report it in the
corresponding stream section.


=item B<-read_intervals> I<read_intervals>


Read only the specified intervals. I<read_intervals> must be a
sequence of interval specifications separated by ",".
B<ffprobe> will seek to the interval starting point, and will
continue reading from that.

Each interval is specified by two optional parts, separated by "%".

The first part specifies the interval start position. It is
interpreted as an absolute position, or as a relative offset from the
current position if it is preceded by the "+" character. If this first
part is not specified, no seeking will be performed when reading this
interval.

The second part specifies the interval end position. It is interpreted
as an absolute position, or as a relative offset from the current
position if it is preceded by the "+" character. If the offset
specification starts with "#", it is interpreted as the number of
packets to read (not including the flushing packets) from the interval
start. If no second part is specified, the program will read until the
end of the input.

Note that seeking is not accurate, thus the actual interval start
point may be different from the specified position. Also, when an
interval duration is specified, the absolute end time will be computed
by adding the duration to the interval start point found by seeking
the file, rather than to the specified start value.

The formal syntax is given by:
	
	<INTERVAL>  ::= [<START>|+<START_OFFSET>][%[<END>|+<END_OFFSET>]]
	<INTERVALS> ::= <INTERVAL>[,<INTERVALS>]


A few examples follow.

=over 4


=item *

Seek to time 10, read packets until 20 seconds after the found seek
point, then seek to position C<01:30> (1 minute and thirty
seconds) and read packets until position C<01:45>.
	
	10%+20,01:30%01:45



=item *

Read only 42 packets after seeking to position C<01:23>:
	
	01:23%+#42



=item *

Read only the first 20 seconds from the start:
	
	%+20



=item *

Read from the start until position C<02:30>:
	
	%02:30


=back



=item B<-show_private_data, -private>

Show private data, that is data depending on the format of the
particular shown element.
This option is enabled by default, but you may need to disable it
for specific uses, for example when creating XSD-compliant XML output.


=item B<-show_program_version>

Show information related to program version.

Version information is printed within a section with name
"PROGRAM_VERSION".


=item B<-show_library_versions>

Show information related to library versions.

Version information for each library is printed within a section with
name "LIBRARY_VERSION".


=item B<-show_versions>

Show information related to program and library versions. This is the
equivalent of setting both B<-show_program_version> and
B<-show_library_versions> options.


=item B<-show_pixel_formats>

Show information about all pixel formats supported by FFmpeg.

Pixel format information for each format is printed within a section
with name "PIXEL_FORMAT".


=item B<-bitexact>

Force bitexact output, useful to produce output which is not dependent
on the specific build.


=item B<-i> I<input_url>

Read I<input_url>.


=back



=head1 WRITERS


A writer defines the output format adopted by B<ffprobe>, and will be
used for printing all the parts of the output.

A writer may accept one or more arguments, which specify the options
to adopt. The options are specified as a list of I<key>=I<value>
pairs, separated by ":".

All writers support the following options:


=over 4


=item B<string_validation, sv>

Set string validation mode.

The following values are accepted.

=over 4


=item B<fail>

The writer will fail immediately in case an invalid string (UTF-8)
sequence or code point is found in the input. This is especially
useful to validate input metadata.


=item B<ignore>

Any validation error will be ignored. This will result in possibly
broken output, especially with the json or xml writer.


=item B<replace>

The writer will substitute invalid UTF-8 sequences or code points with
the string specified with the B<string_validation_replacement>.

=back


Default value is B<replace>.


=item B<string_validation_replacement, svr>

Set replacement string to use in case B<string_validation> is
set to B<replace>.

In case the option is not specified, the writer will assume the empty
string, that is it will remove the invalid sequences from the input
strings.

=back


A description of the currently available writers follows.


=head2 default

Default format.

Print each section in the form:
	
	[SECTION]
	key1=val1
	...
	keyN=valN
	[/SECTION]


Metadata tags are printed as a line in the corresponding FORMAT, STREAM or
PROGRAM_STREAM section, and are prefixed by the string "TAG:".

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4



=item B<nokey, nk>

If set to 1 specify not to print the key of each field. Default value
is 0.


=item B<noprint_wrappers, nw>

If set to 1 specify not to print the section header and footer.
Default value is 0.

=back



=head2 compact, csv

Compact and CSV format.

The C<csv> writer is equivalent to C<compact>, but supports
different defaults.

Each section is printed on a single line.
If no option is specified, the output has the form:
	
	section|key1=val1| ... |keyN=valN


Metadata tags are printed in the corresponding "format" or "stream"
section. A metadata tag key, if printed, is prefixed by the string
"tag:".

The description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4



=item B<item_sep, s>

Specify the character to use for separating fields in the output line.
It must be a single printable character, it is "|" by default ("," for
the C<csv> writer).


=item B<nokey, nk>

If set to 1 specify not to print the key of each field. Its default
value is 0 (1 for the C<csv> writer).


=item B<escape, e>

Set the escape mode to use, default to "c" ("csv" for the C<csv>
writer).

It can assume one of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<c>

Perform C-like escaping. Strings containing a newline (B<\n>), carriage
return (B<\r>), a tab (B<\t>), a form feed (B<\f>), the escaping
character (B<\>) or the item separator character I<SEP> are escaped
using C-like fashioned escaping, so that a newline is converted to the
sequence B<\n>, a carriage return to B<\r>, B<\> to B<\\> and
the separator I<SEP> is converted to B<\>I<SEP>.


=item B<csv>

Perform CSV-like escaping, as described in RFC4180.  Strings
containing a newline (B<\n>), a carriage return (B<\r>), a double quote
(B<">), or I<SEP> are enclosed in double-quotes.


=item B<none>

Perform no escaping.

=back



=item B<print_section, p>

Print the section name at the beginning of each line if the value is
C<1>, disable it with value set to C<0>. Default value is
C<1>.


=back



=head2 flat

Flat format.

A free-form output where each line contains an explicit key=value, such as
"streams.stream.3.tags.foo=bar". The output is shell escaped, so it can be
directly embedded in sh scripts as long as the separator character is an
alphanumeric character or an underscore (see I<sep_char> option).

The description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<sep_char, s>

Separator character used to separate the chapter, the section name, IDs and
potential tags in the printed field key.

Default value is B<.>.


=item B<hierarchical, h>

Specify if the section name specification should be hierarchical. If
set to 1, and if there is more than one section in the current
chapter, the section name will be prefixed by the name of the
chapter. A value of 0 will disable this behavior.

Default value is 1.

=back



=head2 ini

INI format output.

Print output in an INI based format.

The following conventions are adopted:


=over 4


=item *

all key and values are UTF-8

=item *

B<.> is the subgroup separator

=item *

newline, B<\t>, B<\f>, B<\b> and the following characters are
escaped

=item *

B<\> is the escape character

=item *

B<#> is the comment indicator

=item *

B<=> is the key/value separator

=item *

B<:> is not used but usually parsed as key/value separator

=back


This writer accepts options as a list of I<key>=I<value> pairs,
separated by B<:>.

The description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<hierarchical, h>

Specify if the section name specification should be hierarchical. If
set to 1, and if there is more than one section in the current
chapter, the section name will be prefixed by the name of the
chapter. A value of 0 will disable this behavior.

Default value is 1.

=back



=head2 json

JSON based format.

Each section is printed using JSON notation.

The description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4



=item B<compact, c>

If set to 1 enable compact output, that is each section will be
printed on a single line. Default value is 0.

=back


For more information about JSON, see E<lt>B<http://www.json.org/>E<gt>.


=head2 xml

XML based format.

The XML output is described in the XML schema description file
F<ffprobe.xsd> installed in the FFmpeg datadir.

An updated version of the schema can be retrieved at the url
E<lt>B<http://www.ffmpeg.org/schema/ffprobe.xsd>E<gt>, which redirects to the
latest schema committed into the FFmpeg development source code tree.

Note that the output issued will be compliant to the
F<ffprobe.xsd> schema only when no special global output options
(B<unit>, B<prefix>, B<byte_binary_prefix>,
B<sexagesimal> etc.) are specified.

The description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4



=item B<fully_qualified, q>

If set to 1 specify if the output should be fully qualified. Default
value is 0.
This is required for generating an XML file which can be validated
through an XSD file.


=item B<xsd_strict, x>

If set to 1 perform more checks for ensuring that the output is XSD
compliant. Default value is 0.
This option automatically sets B<fully_qualified> to 1.

=back


For more information about the XML format, see
E<lt>B<https://www.w3.org/XML/>E<gt>.


=head1 TIMECODE


B<ffprobe> supports Timecode extraction:


=over 4



=item *

MPEG1/2 timecode is extracted from the GOP, and is available in the video
stream details (B<-show_streams>, see I<timecode>).


=item *

MOV timecode is extracted from tmcd track, so is available in the tmcd
stream metadata (B<-show_streams>, see I<TAG:timecode>).


=item *

DV, GXF and AVI timecodes are available in format metadata
(B<-show_format>, see I<TAG:timecode>).


=back



=head1 SYNTAX


This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
libraries and tools.



=head2 Quoting and escaping


FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:


=over 4


=item *

B<'> and B<\> are special characters (respectively used for
quoting and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other
special characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping
and quoting are employed.


=item *

A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a B<\>.


=item *

All characters enclosed between B<''> are included literally in the
parsed string. The quote character B<'> itself cannot be quoted,
so you may need to close the quote and escape it.


=item *

Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
removed from the parsed string.

=back


Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using
the command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the
adopted shell language.

The function C<av_get_token> defined in
F<libavutil/avstring.h> can be used to parse a token quoted or
escaped according to the rules defined above.

The tool F<tools/ffescape> in the FFmpeg source tree can be used
to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Escape the string C<Crime d'Amour> containing the C<'> special
character:
	
	Crime d\'Amour



=item *

The string above contains a quote, so the C<'> needs to be escaped
when quoting it:
	
	'Crime d'\''Amour'



=item *

Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
	
	'  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '



=item *

Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
	
	' The string '\'string\'' is a string '



=item *

To include a literal B<\> you can use either escaping or quoting:
	
	'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo


=back




=head2 Date


The accepted syntax is:
	
	[(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
	now


If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as UTC.
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year-month-day.



=head2 Time duration


There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.

	
	[-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]


I<HH> expresses the number of hours, I<MM> the number of minutes
for a maximum of 2 digits, and I<SS> the number of seconds for a
maximum of 2 digits. The I<m> at the end expresses decimal value for
I<SS>.

I<or>

	
	[-]<S>+[.<m>...][s|ms|us]


I<S> expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part
I<m>.  The optional literal suffixes B<s>, B<ms> or B<us>
indicate to interpret the value as seconds, milliseconds or microseconds,
respectively.

In both expressions, the optional B<-> indicates negative duration.


=head3 Examples


The following examples are all valid time duration:


=over 4


=item B<55>

55 seconds


=item B<0.2>

0.2 seconds


=item B<200ms>

200 milliseconds, that's 0.2s


=item B<200000us>

200000 microseconds, that's 0.2s


=item B<12:03:45>

12 hours, 03 minutes and 45 seconds


=item B<23.189>

23.189 seconds

=back




=head2 Video size

=head2 Ratio


A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
I<numerator>:I<denominator>.

Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is
considered valid, so you should check on the returned value if you
want to exclude those values.

The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.



=head2 Color


It can be the name of a color as defined below (case insensitive match) or a
C<[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA]> sequence, possibly followed by @ and a string
representing the alpha component.

The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an
hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the opacity value (B<0x00> or B<0.0> means completely
transparent, B<0xff> or B<1.0> completely opaque). If the alpha
component is not specified then B<0xff> is assumed.

The string B<random> will result in a random color.

A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms, separated by
'+' or '|'. Each term can be:

=over 4


=item *

the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. B<mono>,
B<stereo>, B<4.0>, B<quad>, B<5.0>, etc.)


=item *

the name of a single channel (e.g. B<FL>, B<FR>, B<FC>, B<LFE>, etc.)


=item *

a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'c', yielding the default channel
layout for that number of channels (see the function
C<av_get_default_channel_layout>). Note that not all channel counts have a
default layout.


=item *

a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'C', yielding an unknown channel
layout with the specified number of channels. Note that not all channel layout
specification strings support unknown channel layouts.


=item *

a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with "0x" (see the
C<AV_CH_*> macros in F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.

=back


Before libavutil version 53 the trailing character "c" to specify a number of
channels was optional, but now it is required, while a channel layout mask can
also be specified as a decimal number (if and only if not followed by "c" or "C").

See also the function C<av_get_channel_layout> defined in
F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.


=head1 EXPRESSION EVALUATION


When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
formula evaluator, implemented through the F<libavutil/eval.h>
interface.

An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
functions.

Two expressions I<expr1> and I<expr2> can be combined to form
another expression "I<expr1>;I<expr2>".
I<expr1> and I<expr2> are evaluated in turn, and the new

=item B<root(expr, max)>

Find an input value for which the function represented by I<expr>
with argument I<ld(0)> is 0 in the interval 0..I<max>.

The expression in I<expr> must denote a continuous function or the
result is undefined.

I<ld(0)> is used to represent the function input value, which means
that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times with
various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(0)>. When the expression evaluates to 0 then the
corresponding input value will be returned.


=item B<round(expr)>

the C<ld(id)>-th derivative of a function at 0.

When the series does not converge the result is undefined.

I<ld(id)> is used to represent the derivative order in I<expr>,
which means that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times
with various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(id)>. If I<id> is not specified then 0 is assumed.

Note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0,
C<taylor(expr, x-y)> can be used.


=item B<time(0)>

=item B<trunc(expr)>

Round the value of expression I<expr> towards zero to the nearest
integer. For example, "trunc(-1.5)" is "-1.0".

The following constants are available:

=over 4


=item B<PI>

area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14

=item B<E>

exp(1) (Euler's number), approximately 2.718

=item B<PHI>

Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a non-zero
value, note that:

C<*> works like AND

C<+> works like OR

For example the construct:
	
	if (A AND B) then C

is equivalent to:
	
	if(A*B, C)


In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
expressions.

The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
The 'B' postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a
unit prefix or used alone. This allows using for example 'KB', 'MiB',
'G' and 'B' as number postfix.

The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

=head1 CODEC OPTIONS


libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.

Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVCodecContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follow:


=over 4


=item B<b> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio,video>B<)>

Set bitrate in bits/s. Default value is 200K.

=item B<bt> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,video>B<)>

Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode, bitrate
tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from the
target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max
bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on quality.

This codec decodes the bitmap subtitles used in DVDs; the same subtitles can
also be found in VobSub file pairs and in some Matroska files.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<palette>

Specify the global palette used by the bitmaps. When stored in VobSub, the
palette is normally specified in the index file; in Matroska, the palette is
stored in the codec extra-data in the same format as in VobSub. In DVDs, the
palette is stored in the IFO file, and therefore not available when reading
from dumped VOB files.

The format for this option is a string containing 16 24-bits hexadecimal
numbers (without 0x prefix) separated by commas, for example C<0d00ee,
ee450d, 101010, eaeaea, 0ce60b, ec14ed, ebff0b, 0d617a, 7b7b7b, d1d1d1,
7b2a0e, 0d950c, 0f007b, cf0dec, cfa80c, 7c127b>.


=item B<ifo_palette>

Specify the IFO file from which the global palette is obtained.
(experimental)


=item B<forced_subs_only>

Only decode subtitle entries marked as forced. Some titles have forced
and non-forced subtitles in the same track. Setting this flag to C<1>
will only keep the forced subtitles. Default value is C<0>.

=back



=head2 libzvbi-teletext


Libzvbi allows libavcodec to decode DVB teletext pages and DVB teletext
subtitles. Requires the presence of the libzvbi headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libzvbi>.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<txt_page>

List of teletext page numbers to decode. Pages that do not match the specified
list are dropped. You may use the special C<*> string to match all pages,
or C<subtitle> to match all subtitle pages.
Default value is *.

=item B<txt_default_region>

Set default character set used for decoding, a value between 0 and 87 (see
ETS 300 706, Section 15, Table 32). Default value is -1, which does not
override the libzvbi default. This option is needed for some legacy level 1.0
transmissions which cannot signal the proper charset.

=item B<txt_chop_top>

Discards the top teletext line. Default value is 1.

=item B<txt_format>

Specifies the format of the decoded subtitles.

=over 4


=item B<bitmap>

The default format, you should use this for teletext pages, because certain
graphics and colors cannot be expressed in simple text or even ASS.

=item B<text>

Simple text based output without formatting.

=item B<ass>

Formatted ASS output, subtitle pages and teletext pages are returned in
different styles, subtitle pages are stripped down to text, but an effort is
made to keep the text alignment and the formatting.

=back


=item B<txt_left>

X offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

=item B<txt_top>

Y offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

=item B<txt_chop_spaces>

Chops leading and trailing spaces and removes empty lines from the generated
text. This option is useful for teletext based subtitles where empty spaces may
be present at the start or at the end of the lines or empty lines may be
present between the subtitle lines because of double-sized teletext characters.
Default value is 1.

=item B<txt_duration>

Sets the display duration of the decoded teletext pages or subtitles in
milliseconds. Default value is -1 which means infinity or until the next
subtitle event comes.

=item B<txt_transparent>

Force transparent background of the generated teletext bitmaps. Default value
is 0 which means an opaque background.

=item B<txt_opacity>

Sets the opacity (0-255) of the teletext background. If
B<txt_transparent> is not set, it only affects characters between a start
box and an end box, typically subtitles. Default value is 0 if
B<txt_transparent> is set, 255 otherwise.


=back



=head1 BITSTREAM FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported bitstream
filters are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using
the configure option C<--list-bsfs>.

You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure option
C<--disable-bsfs>, and selectively enable any bitstream filter using
the option C<--enable-bsf=BSF>, or you can disable a particular
bitstream filter using the option C<--disable-bsf=BSF>.

The option C<-bsfs> of the ff* tools will display the list of
all the supported bitstream filters included in your build.

The ff* tools have a -bsf option applied per stream, taking a
comma-separated list of filters, whose parameters follow the filter
name after a '='.

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v filter1[=opt1=str1:opt2=str2][,filter2] OUTPUT


Below is a description of the currently available bitstream filters,
with their parameters, if any.


=head2 aac_adtstoasc


Convert MPEG-2/4 AAC ADTS to an MPEG-4 Audio Specific Configuration
bitstream.

This filter creates an MPEG-4 AudioSpecificConfig from an MPEG-2/4
ADTS header and removes the ADTS header.

This filter is required for example when copying an AAC stream from a
raw ADTS AAC or an MPEG-TS container to MP4A-LATM, to an FLV file, or
to MOV/MP4 files and related formats such as 3GP or M4A. Please note
that it is auto-inserted for MP4A-LATM and MOV/MP4 and related formats.


=head2 av1_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an AV1 stream.


=over 4


=item B<td>

Insert or remove temporal delimiter OBUs in all temporal units of the
stream.


=over 4


=item B<insert>

Insert a TD at the beginning of every TU which does not already have one.

=item B<remove>

Remove the TD from the beginning of every TU which has one.

=back



=item B<color_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the color description fields in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2).


=item B<color_range>

Set the color range in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2; note that
this cannot be set for streams using BT.709 primaries, sRGB transfer
characteristic and identity (RGB) matrix coefficients).

=over 4


=item B<tv>

Limited range.

=item B<pc>

Full range.

=back



=item B<chroma_sample_position>

Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2).
This can only be set for 4:2:0 streams.


=over 4


=item B<vertical>

Left position (matching the default in MPEG-2 and H.264).

=item B<colocated>

Top-left position.

=back



=item B<tick_rate>

Set the tick rate (I<num_units_in_display_tick / time_scale>) in
the timing info in the sequence header.

=item B<num_ticks_per_picture>

Set the number of ticks in each picture, to indicate that the stream
has a fixed framerate.  Ignored if B<tick_rate> is not also set.


=item B<delete_padding>

Deletes Padding OBUs.


=back



=head2 chomp


Remove zero padding at the end of a packet.


=head2 dca_core


Extract the core from a DCA/DTS stream, dropping extensions such as
DTS-HD.


=head2 dump_extra


Add extradata to the beginning of the filtered packets except when
said packets already exactly begin with the extradata that is intended
to be added.


=over 4


=item B<freq>

The additional argument specifies which packets should be filtered.
It accepts the values:

=over 4


=item B<k>


=item B<keyframe>

add extradata to all key packets


=item B<e>


=item B<all>

add extradata to all packets

=back


=back


If not specified it is assumed B<k>.

For example the following B<ffmpeg> command forces a global
header (thus disabling individual packet headers) in the H.264 packets
generated by the C<libx264> encoder, but corrects them by adding
the header stored in extradata to the key packets:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -flags:v +global_header -c:v libx264 -bsf:v dump_extra out.ts



=head2 eac3_core


Extract the core from a E-AC-3 stream, dropping extra channels.


=head2 extract_extradata


Extract the in-band extradata.

Certain codecs allow the long-term headers (e.g. MPEG-2 sequence headers,
or H.264/HEVC (VPS/)SPS/PPS) to be transmitted either "in-band" (i.e. as a part
of the bitstream containing the coded frames) or "out of band" (e.g. on the
container level). This latter form is called "extradata" in FFmpeg terminology.

This bitstream filter detects the in-band headers and makes them available as
extradata.


=over 4


=item B<remove>

When this option is enabled, the long-term headers are removed from the
bitstream after extraction.

=back



=head2 filter_units


Remove units with types in or not in a given set from the stream.


=over 4


=item B<pass_types>

List of unit types or ranges of unit types to pass through while removing
all others.  This is specified as a '|'-separated list of unit type values
or ranges of values with '-'.


=item B<remove_types>

Identical to B<pass_types>, except the units in the given set
removed and all others passed through.

=back


Extradata is unchanged by this transformation, but note that if the stream
contains inline parameter sets then the output may be unusable if they are
removed.

For example, to remove all non-VCL NAL units from an H.264 stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v 'filter_units=pass_types=1-5' OUTPUT


To remove all AUDs, SEI and filler from an H.265 stream:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v 'filter_units=remove_types=35|38-40' OUTPUT



=head2 hapqa_extract


Extract Rgb or Alpha part of an HAPQA file, without recompression, in order to create an HAPQ or an HAPAlphaOnly file.


=over 4


=item B<texture>

Specifies the texture to keep.


=over 4


=item B<color>


=item B<alpha>


=back



=back


Convert HAPQA to HAPQ
	
	ffmpeg -i hapqa_inputfile.mov -c copy -bsf:v hapqa_extract=texture=color -tag:v HapY -metadata:s:v:0 encoder="HAPQ" hapq_file.mov


Convert HAPQA to HAPAlphaOnly
	
	ffmpeg -i hapqa_inputfile.mov -c copy -bsf:v hapqa_extract=texture=alpha -tag:v HapA -metadata:s:v:0 encoder="HAPAlpha Only" hapalphaonly_file.mov



=head2 h264_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an H.264 stream.


=over 4


=item B<aud>

Insert or remove AUD NAL units in all access units of the stream.


=over 4


=item B<insert>


=item B<remove>


=back



=item B<sample_aspect_ratio>

Set the sample aspect ratio of the stream in the VUI parameters.


=item B<overscan_appropriate_flag>

Set whether the stream is suitable for display using overscan
or not (see H.264 section E.2.1).


=item B<video_format>


=item B<video_full_range_flag>

Set the video format in the stream (see H.264 section E.2.1 and
table E-2).


=item B<colour_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the colour description in the stream (see H.264 section E.2.1
and tables E-3, E-4 and E-5).


=item B<chroma_sample_loc_type>

Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see H.264 section
E.2.1 and figure E-1).


=item B<tick_rate>

Set the tick rate (num_units_in_tick / time_scale) in the VUI
parameters.  This is the smallest time unit representable in the
stream, and in many cases represents the field rate of the stream
(double the frame rate).

=item B<fixed_frame_rate_flag>

Set whether the stream has fixed framerate - typically this indicates
that the framerate is exactly half the tick rate, but the exact
meaning is dependent on interlacing and the picture structure (see
H.264 section E.2.1 and table E-6).


=item B<crop_left>


=item B<crop_right>


=item B<crop_top>


=item B<crop_bottom>

Set the frame cropping offsets in the SPS.  These values will replace
the current ones if the stream is already cropped.

These fields are set in pixels.  Note that some sizes may not be
representable if the chroma is subsampled or the stream is interlaced
(see H.264 section 7.4.2.1.1).


=item B<sei_user_data>

Insert a string as SEI unregistered user data.  The argument must
be of the form I<UUID+string>, where the UUID is as hex digits
possibly separated by hyphens, and the string can be anything.

For example, B<086f3693-b7b3-4f2c-9653-21492feee5b8+hello> will
insert the string ``hello'' associated with the given UUID.


=item B<delete_filler>

Deletes both filler NAL units and filler SEI messages.


=item B<level>

Set the level in the SPS.  Refer to H.264 section A.3 and tables A-1
to A-5.

The argument must be the name of a level (for example, B<4.2>), a
level_idc value (for example, B<42>), or the special name B<auto>
indicating that the filter should attempt to guess the level from the
input stream properties.


=back



=head2 h264_mp4toannexb


Convert an H.264 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.264
specification).

This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
transport stream format (muxer C<mpegts>).

For example to remux an MP4 file containing an H.264 stream to mpegts
format with B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts


Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
C<mpegts>) and raw H.264 (muxer C<h264>) output formats.


=head2 h264_redundant_pps


This applies a specific fixup to some Blu-ray streams which contain
redundant PPSs modifying irrelevant parameters of the stream which
confuse other transformations which require correct extradata.

A new single global PPS is created, and all of the redundant PPSs
within the stream are removed.


=head2 hevc_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an HEVC stream.


=over 4


=item B<aud>

Insert or remove AUD NAL units in all access units of the stream.


=over 4


=item B<insert>


=item B<remove>


=back



=item B<sample_aspect_ratio>

Set the sample aspect ratio in the stream in the VUI parameters.


=item B<video_format>


=item B<video_full_range_flag>

Set the video format in the stream (see H.265 section E.3.1 and
table E.2).


=item B<colour_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the colour description in the stream (see H.265 section E.3.1
and tables E.3, E.4 and E.5).


=item B<chroma_sample_loc_type>

Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see H.265 section
E.3.1 and figure E.1).


=item B<tick_rate>

Set the tick rate in the VPS and VUI parameters (num_units_in_tick /
time_scale).  Combined with B<num_ticks_poc_diff_one>, this can
set a constant framerate in the stream.  Note that it is likely to be
overridden by container parameters when the stream is in a container.


=item B<num_ticks_poc_diff_one>

Set poc_proportional_to_timing_flag in VPS and VUI and use this value
to set num_ticks_poc_diff_one_minus1 (see H.265 sections 7.4.3.1 and
E.3.1).  Ignored if B<tick_rate> is not also set.


=item B<crop_left>


=item B<crop_right>


=item B<crop_top>


=item B<crop_bottom>

Set the conformance window cropping offsets in the SPS.  These values
will replace the current ones if the stream is already cropped.

These fields are set in pixels.  Note that some sizes may not be
representable if the chroma is subsampled (H.265 section 7.4.3.2.1).


=item B<level>

Set the level in the VPS and SPS.  See H.265 section A.4 and tables
A.6 and A.7.

The argument must be the name of a level (for example, B<5.1>), a
I<general_level_idc> value (for example, B<153> for level 5.1),
or the special name B<auto> indicating that the filter should
attempt to guess the level from the input stream properties.


=back



=head2 hevc_mp4toannexb


Convert an HEVC/H.265 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.265
specification).

This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
transport stream format (muxer C<mpegts>).

For example to remux an MP4 file containing an HEVC stream to mpegts
format with B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v hevc_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts


Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
C<mpegts>) and raw HEVC/H.265 (muxer C<h265> or
C<hevc>) output formats.


=head2 imxdump


Modifies the bitstream to fit in MOV and to be usable by the Final Cut
Pro decoder. This filter only applies to the mpeg2video codec, and is
likely not needed for Final Cut Pro 7 and newer with the appropriate
B<-tag:v>.

For example, to remux 30 MB/sec NTSC IMX to MOV:

	
	ffmpeg -i input.mxf -c copy -bsf:v imxdump -tag:v mx3n output.mov



=head2 mjpeg2jpeg


Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is essentially a
JPEG image. The individual frames can be extracted without loss,
e.g. by

	
	ffmpeg -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg


Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images, because
they lack the DHT segment required for decoding. Quoting from
E<lt>B<http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml>E<gt>:

Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the
MJPG fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed -- and *omitted* --
Huffman table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2,
and it must use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or
progressive. . . . You can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and
decode them with a regular JPEG decoder, but you have to prepend
the DHT segment to them, or else the decoder won't have any idea
how to decompress the data. The exact table necessary is given in
the OpenDML spec."

This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted from an MJPEG
stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and lacking a DHT segment) to
produce fully qualified JPEG images.

	
	ffmpeg -i mjpeg-movie.avi -c:v copy -bsf:v mjpeg2jpeg frame_%d.jpg
	exiftran -i -9 frame*.jpg
	ffmpeg -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v copy rotated.avi



=head2 mjpegadump


Add an MJPEG A header to the bitstream, to enable decoding by
Quicktime.



=head2 mov2textsub


Extract a representable text file from MOV subtitles, stripping the
metadata header from each subtitle packet.

See also the B<text2movsub> filter.


=head2 mp3decomp


Decompress non-standard compressed MP3 audio headers.


=head2 mpeg2_metadata


Modify metadata embedded in an MPEG-2 stream.


=over 4


=item B<display_aspect_ratio>

Set the display aspect ratio in the stream.

The following fixed values are supported:

=over 4


=item B<4/3>


=item B<16/9>


=item B<221/100>


=back

Any other value will result in square pixels being signalled instead
(see H.262 section 6.3.3 and table 6-3).


=item B<frame_rate>

Set the frame rate in the stream.  This is constructed from a table
of known values combined with a small multiplier and divisor - if
the supplied value is not exactly representable, the nearest
representable value will be used instead (see H.262 section 6.3.3
and table 6-4).


=item B<video_format>

Set the video format in the stream (see H.262 section 6.3.6 and
table 6-6).


=item B<colour_primaries>


=item B<transfer_characteristics>


=item B<matrix_coefficients>

Set the colour description in the stream (see H.262 section 6.3.6
and tables 6-7, 6-8 and 6-9).


=back



=head2 mpeg4_unpack_bframes


Unpack DivX-style packed B-frames.

DivX-style packed B-frames are not valid MPEG-4 and were only a
workaround for the broken Video for Windows subsystem.
They use more space, can cause minor AV sync issues, require more
CPU power to decode (unless the player has some decoded picture queue
to compensate the 2,0,2,0 frame per packet style) and cause
trouble if copied into a standard container like mp4 or mpeg-ps/ts,
because MPEG-4 decoders may not be able to decode them, since they are
not valid MPEG-4.

For example to fix an AVI file containing an MPEG-4 stream with
DivX-style packed B-frames using B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.avi -codec copy -bsf:v mpeg4_unpack_bframes OUTPUT.avi



=head2 noise


Damages the contents of packets or simply drops them without damaging the
container. Can be used for fuzzing or testing error resilience/concealment.

Parameters:

=over 4


=item B<amount>

A numeral string, whose value is related to how often output bytes will
be modified. Therefore, values below or equal to 0 are forbidden, and
the lower the more frequent bytes will be modified, with 1 meaning
every byte is modified.

=item B<dropamount>

A numeral string, whose value is related to how often packets will be dropped.
Therefore, values below or equal to 0 are forbidden, and the lower the more
frequent packets will be dropped, with 1 meaning every packet is dropped.

=back


The following example applies the modification to every byte but does not drop
any packets.
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c copy -bsf noise[=1] output.mkv



=head2 null

This bitstream filter passes the packets through unchanged.


=head2 pcm_rechunk


Repacketize PCM audio to a fixed number of samples per packet or a fixed packet
rate per second. This is similar to the B<asetnsamples audio
filter> but works on audio packets instead of audio frames.


=over 4


=item B<nb_out_samples, n>

Set the number of samples per each output audio packet. The number is intended
as the number of samples I<per each channel>. Default value is 1024.


=item B<pad, p>

If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio packet with silence, so that it
will contain the same number of samples (or roughly the same number of samples,
see B<frame_rate>) as the previous ones. Default value is 1.


=item B<frame_rate, r>

This option makes the filter output a fixed number of packets per second instead
of a fixed number of samples per packet. If the audio sample rate is not
divisible by the frame rate then the number of samples will not be constant but
will vary slightly so that each packet will start as close to the frame
boundary as possible. Using this option has precedence over B<nb_out_samples>.

=back


You can generate the well known 1602-1601-1602-1601-1602 pattern of 48kHz audio
for NTSC frame rate using the B<frame_rate> option.

=head1 FORMAT OPTIONS


The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the muxers and demuxers. In addition each muxer or
demuxer may support so-called private options, which are specific for
that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<avioflags> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<direct>

Reduce buffering.

=back



=item B<probesize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set probing size in bytes, i.e. the size of the data to analyze to get
stream information. A higher value will enable detecting more
information in case it is dispersed into the stream, but will increase
latency. Must be an integer not lesser than 32. It is 5000000 by default.


=item B<max_probe_packets> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set the maximum number of buffered packets when probing a codec.
Default is 2500 packets.


=item B<packetsize> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set packet size.


=item B<fflags> I<flags>

Set format flags. Some are implemented for a limited number of formats.

Possible values for input files:

=item B<igndts>

Ignore DTS if PTS is set. Inert when nofillin is set.

=item B<ignidx>

Ignore index.

=item B<keepside (>I<deprecated>B<,>I<inert>B<)>


=item B<nobuffer>

Reduce the latency introduced by buffering during initial input streams analysis.

=item B<nofillin>

Do not fill in missing values in packet fields that can be exactly calculated.

=item B<noparse>

Disable AVParsers, this needs C<+nofillin> too.

=item B<sortdts>

Try to interleave output packets by DTS. At present, available only for AVIs with an index.

=back


Possible values for output files:

=over 4


=item B<autobsf>

Automatically apply bitstream filters as required by the output format. Enabled by default.

=item B<bitexact>

Only write platform-, build- and time-independent data.
This ensures that file and data checksums are reproducible and match between
platforms. Its primary use is for regression testing.

=item B<flush_packets>

Write out packets immediately.

=item B<latm (>I<deprecated>B<,>I<inert>B<)>


=item B<shortest>

Stop muxing at the end of the shortest stream.
It may be needed to increase max_interleave_delta to avoid flushing the longer
streams before EOF.

=back



=item B<seek2any> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Allow seeking to non-keyframes on demuxer level when supported if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<analyzeduration> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Specify how many microseconds are analyzed to probe the input. A
higher value will enable detecting more accurate information, but will
increase latency. It defaults to 5,000,000 microseconds = 5 seconds.


=item B<cryptokey> I<hexadecimal string> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set decryption key.


=item B<indexmem> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set max memory used for timestamp index (per stream).


=item B<rtbufsize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set max memory used for buffering real-time frames.


=item B<fdebug> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<ts>


=back



=item B<max_delay> I<integer> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Set maximum muxing or demuxing delay in microseconds.


=item B<fpsprobesize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set size in bytes for each chunk.


=item B<err_detect, f_err_detect> I<flags> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set error detection flags. C<f_err_detect> is deprecated and
should be used only via the B<ffmpeg> tool.

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<crccheck>

Verify embedded CRCs.

=item B<bitstream>

Detect bitstream specification deviations.

=item B<buffer>

Abort decoding on minor error detection.

=item B<careful>

Consider things that violate the spec and have not been seen in the
wild as errors.

=item B<compliant>

Consider all spec non compliancies as errors.

=item B<aggressive>

Consider things that a sane encoder should not do as an error.

=back



=item B<max_interleave_delta> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set maximum buffering duration for interleaving. The duration is
expressed in microseconds, and defaults to 10000000 (10 seconds).

To ensure all the streams are interleaved correctly, libavformat will
wait until it has at least one packet for each stream before actually
writing any packets to the output file. When some streams are
"sparse" (i.e. there are large gaps between successive packets), this
can result in excessive buffering.

This field specifies the maximum difference between the timestamps of the
first and the last packet in the muxing queue, above which libavformat
will output a packet regardless of whether it has queued a packet for all
the streams.

If set to 0, libavformat will continue buffering packets until it has
a packet for each stream, regardless of the maximum timestamp
difference between the buffered packets.


=item B<use_wallclock_as_timestamps> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Use wallclock as timestamps if set to 1. Default is 0.


=item B<avoid_negative_ts> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>


Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<make_non_negative>

Shift timestamps to make them non-negative.
Also note that this affects only leading negative timestamps, and not
non-monotonic negative timestamps.

=item B<make_zero>

Shift timestamps so that the first timestamp is 0.

=item B<auto (default)>

Enables shifting when required by the target format.

=item B<disabled>

Disables shifting of timestamp.

=back


When shifting is enabled, all output timestamps are shifted by the
same amount. Audio, video, and subtitles desynching and relative
timestamp differences are preserved compared to how they would have
been without shifting.


=item B<skip_initial_bytes> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set number of bytes to skip before reading header and frames if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<correct_ts_overflow> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Correct single timestamp overflows if set to 1. Default is 1.


=item B<flush_packets> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Flush the underlying I/O stream after each packet. Default is -1 (auto), which
means that the underlying protocol will decide, 1 enables it, and has the
effect of reducing the latency, 0 disables it and may increase IO throughput in
some cases.


=item B<output_ts_offset> I<offset> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the output time offset.

I<offset> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

The offset is added by the muxer to the output timestamps.

Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are
delayed bt the time duration specified in I<offset>. Default value
is C<0> (meaning that no offset is applied).


=item B<format_whitelist> I<list> B<(>I<input>B<)>

"," separated list of allowed demuxers. By default all are allowed.


=item B<dump_separator> I<string> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Separator used to separate the fields printed on the command line about the
Stream parameters.
For example, to separate the fields with newlines and indentation:
	
	ffprobe -dump_separator "
	                          "  -i ~/videos/matrixbench_mpeg2.mpg



=item B<max_streams> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Specifies the maximum number of streams. This can be used to reject files that
would require too many resources due to a large number of streams.


=item B<skip_estimate_duration_from_pts> I<bool> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Skip estimation of input duration when calculated using PTS.
At present, applicable for MPEG-PS and MPEG-TS.


=item B<strict, f_strict> I<integer> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Specify how strictly to follow the standards. C<f_strict> is deprecated and
should be used only via the B<ffmpeg> tool.

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<very>

strictly conform to an older more strict version of the spec or reference software

=item B<strict>

strictly conform to all the things in the spec no matter what consequences

=item B<normal>



=item B<unofficial>

allow unofficial extensions

=item B<experimental>

allow non standardized experimental things, experimental
(unfinished/work in progress/not well tested) decoders and encoders.
Note: experimental decoders can pose a security risk, do not use this for
decoding untrusted input.

=back



=back





=head2 Format stream specifiers


Format stream specifiers allow selection of one or more streams that
match specific properties.

The exact semantics of stream specifiers is defined by the
C<avformat_match_stream_specifier()> function declared in the
F<libavformat/avformat.h> header and documented in the
B<Stream specifiers section in the ffmpeg(1) manual>.


=head1 DEMUXERS


Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg that can read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option C<--list-demuxers>.

You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
C<--disable-demuxers>, and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option C<--enable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>, or disable it
with the option C<--disable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>.

The option C<-demuxers> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers. Use C<-formats> to view a combined list of
enabled demuxers and muxers.

The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.


=head2 aa


Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 (.aa) files.


=head2 apng


Animated Portable Network Graphics demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux APNG files.
All headers, but the PNG signature, up to (but not including) the first
fcTL chunk are transmitted as extradata.
Frames are then split as being all the chunks between two fcTL ones, or
between the last fcTL and IEND chunks.


=over 4


=item B<-ignore_loop> I<bool>

Ignore the loop variable in the file if set.

=item B<-max_fps> I<int>

Maximum framerate in frames per second (0 for no limit).

=item B<-default_fps> I<int>

Default framerate in frames per second when none is specified in the file
(0 meaning as fast as possible).

=back



=head2 asf


Advanced Systems Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux ASF files and MMS network streams.


=over 4


=item B<-no_resync_search> I<bool>

Do not try to resynchronize by looking for a certain optional start code.

=back




=head2 concat


Virtual concatenation script demuxer.

This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packets had been muxed
together.

The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.

All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).

The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
C<duration> directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.


=head3 Syntax


The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
following directive is recognized:


=over 4



=item B<C<file I<path>>>

Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.

All subsequent file-related directives apply to that file.


=item B<C<ffconcat version 1.0>>

Identify the script type and version. It also sets the B<safe> option
to 1 if it was -1.

To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appear exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first
line of the script.


=item B<C<duration I<dur>>>

Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.

If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the
whole concatenated video.


=item B<C<inpoint I<timestamp>>>

In point of the file. When the demuxer opens the file it instantly seeks to the
specified timestamp. Seeking is done so that all streams can be presented
successfully at In point.

This directive works best with intra frame codecs, because for non-intra frame
ones you will usually get extra packets before the actual In point and the
decoded content will most likely contain frames before In point too.

For each file, packets before the file In point will have timestamps less than
the calculated start timestamp of the file (negative in case of the first
file), and the duration of the files (if not specified by the C<duration>
directive) will be reduced based on their specified In point.

Because of potential packets before the specified In point, packet timestamps
may overlap between two concatenated files.


=item B<C<outpoint I<timestamp>>>

Out point of the file. When the demuxer reaches the specified decoding
timestamp in any of the streams, it handles it as an end of file condition and
skips the current and all the remaining packets from all streams.

Out point is exclusive, which means that the demuxer will not output packets
with a decoding timestamp greater or equal to Out point.

This directive works best with intra frame codecs and formats where all streams
are tightly interleaved. For non-intra frame codecs you will usually get
additional packets with presentation timestamp after Out point therefore the
decoded content will most likely contain frames after Out point too. If your
streams are not tightly interleaved you may not get all the packets from all
streams before Out point and you may only will be able to decode the earliest
stream until Out point.

The duration of the files (if not specified by the C<duration>
directive) will be reduced based on their specified Out point.


=item B<C<file_packet_metadata I<key=value>>>

Metadata of the packets of the file. The specified metadata will be set for
each file packet. You can specify this directive multiple times to add multiple
metadata entries.


=item B<C<stream>>

Introduce a stream in the virtual file.
All subsequent stream-related directives apply to the last introduced
stream.
Some streams properties must be set in order to allow identifying the
matching streams in the subfiles.
If no streams are defined in the script, the streams from the first file are
copied.


=item B<C<exact_stream_id I<id>>>

Set the id of the stream.
If this directive is given, the string with the corresponding id in the
subfiles will be used.
This is especially useful for MPEG-PS (VOB) files, where the order of the
streams is not reliable.


=back



=head3 Options


This demuxer accepts the following option:


=over 4



=item B<safe>

If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths. A file path is considered safe if it
does not contain a protocol specification and is relative and all components
only contain characters from the portable character set (letters, digits,
period, underscore and hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a
component.

If set to 0, any file name is accepted.

The default is 1.

-1 is equivalent to 1 if the format was automatically
probed and 0 otherwise.


=item B<auto_convert>

If set to 1, try to perform automatic conversions on packet data to make the
streams concatenable.
The default is 1.

Currently, the only conversion is adding the h264_mp4toannexb bitstream
filter to H.264 streams in MP4 format. This is necessary in particular if
there are resolution changes.


=item B<segment_time_metadata>

If set to 1, every packet will contain the I<lavf.concat.start_time> and the
I<lavf.concat.duration> packet metadata values which are the start_time and
the duration of the respective file segments in the concatenated output
expressed in microseconds. The duration metadata is only set if it is known
based on the concat file.
The default is 0.


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Use absolute filenames and include some comments:
	
	# my first filename
	file /mnt/share/file-1.wav
	# my second filename including whitespace
	file '/mnt/share/file 2.wav'
	# my third filename including whitespace plus single quote
	file '/mnt/share/file 3'\''.wav'



=item *

Allow for input format auto-probing, use safe filenames and set the duration of
the first file:
	
	ffconcat version 1.0
	
	file file-1.wav
	duration 20.0
	
	file subdir/file-2.wav


=back



=head2 dash


Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP demuxer.

This demuxer presents all AVStreams found in the manifest.
By setting the discard flags on AVStreams the caller can decide
which streams to actually receive.
Each stream mirrors the C<id> and C<bandwidth> properties from the
C<E<lt>RepresentationE<gt>> as metadata keys named "id" and "variant_bitrate" respectively.


=head2 flv, live_flv


Adobe Flash Video Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux FLV files and RTMP network streams. In case of live network streams, if you force format, you may use live_flv option instead of flv to survive timestamp discontinuities.

	
	ffmpeg -f flv -i myfile.flv ...
	ffmpeg -f live_flv -i rtmp://<any.server>/anything/key ....




=over 4


=item B<-flv_metadata> I<bool>

Allocate the streams according to the onMetaData array content.


=item B<-flv_ignore_prevtag> I<bool>

Ignore the size of previous tag value.


=item B<-flv_full_metadata> I<bool>

Output all context of the onMetadata.

=back



=head2 gif


Animated GIF demuxer.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<min_delay>

Set the minimum valid delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 2.


=item B<max_gif_delay>

Set the maximum valid delay between frames in hundredth of seconds.
Range is 0 to 65535. Default value is 65535 (nearly eleven minutes),
the maximum value allowed by the specification.


=item B<default_delay>

Set the default delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 10.


=item B<ignore_loop>

GIF files can contain information to loop a certain number of times (or
infinitely). If B<ignore_loop> is set to 1, then the loop setting
from the input will be ignored and looping will not occur. If set to 0,
then looping will occur and will cycle the number of times according to
the GIF. Default value is 1.

=back


For example, with the overlay filter, place an infinitely looping GIF
over another video:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ignore_loop 0 -i input.gif -filter_complex overlay=shortest=1 out.mkv


Note that in the above example the shortest option for overlay filter is
used to end the output video at the length of the shortest input file,
which in this case is F<input.mp4> as the GIF in this example loops
infinitely.


=head2 hls


HLS demuxer

Apple HTTP Live Streaming demuxer.

This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.
The id field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting
the discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay),
the caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.
The total bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is
available in a metadata key named "variant_bitrate".

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<live_start_index>

segment index to start live streams at (negative values are from the end).


=item B<allowed_extensions>

',' separated list of file extensions that hls is allowed to access.


=item B<max_reload>

Maximum number of times a insufficient list is attempted to be reloaded.
Default value is 1000.


=item B<m3u8_hold_counters>

The maximum number of times to load m3u8 when it refreshes without new segments.
Default value is 1000.


=item B<http_persistent>

Use persistent HTTP connections. Applicable only for HTTP streams.
Enabled by default.


=item B<http_multiple>

Use multiple HTTP connections for downloading HTTP segments.
Enabled by default for HTTP/1.1 servers.


=item B<http_seekable>

Use HTTP partial requests for downloading HTTP segments.
0 = disable, 1 = enable, -1 = auto, Default is auto.

=back



=head2 image2


Image file demuxer.

This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the
option I<pattern_type>.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.

The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<framerate>

Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.

=item B<loop>

If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

=item B<pattern_type>

Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.

I<pattern_type> accepts one of the following values.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Disable pattern matching, therefore the video will only contain the specified
image. You should use this option if you do not want to create sequences from
multiple images and your filenames may contain special pattern characters.

=item B<sequence>

Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.

A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
"%d0I<N>d" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0-padded and I<N> is the total number of 0-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string "%%".

If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between I<start_number> and
I<start_number>+I<start_number_range>-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.; the pattern "i%%m%%g-%d.jpg" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form F<i%m%g-1.jpg>,
F<i%m%g-2.jpg>, ..., F<i%m%g-10.jpg>, etc.

Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to convert a single image file
F<img.jpeg> you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png



=item B<glob>

Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

The pattern is interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.


=item B<glob_sequence> I<(deprecated, will be removed)>

Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
C<%*?[]{}> that is preceded by an unescaped "%", the pattern is
interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.

All glob special characters C<%*?[]{}> must be prefixed
with "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall use "%%".

For example the pattern C<foo-%*.jpeg> will match all the
filenames prefixed by "foo-" and terminating with ".jpeg", and
C<foo-%?%?%?.jpeg> will match all the filenames prefixed with
"foo-", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with ".jpeg".

This pattern type is deprecated in favor of I<glob> and
I<sequence>.

=back


Default value is I<glob_sequence>.

=item B<pixel_format>

Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not specified the pixel
format is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=item B<start_number>

Set the index of the file matched by the image file pattern to start
to read from. Default value is 0.

=item B<start_number_range>

Set the index interval range to check when looking for the first image
file in the sequence, starting from I<start_number>. Default value
is 5.

=item B<ts_from_file>

If set to 1, will set frame timestamp to modification time of image file. Note
that monotonity of timestamps is not provided: images go in the same order as
without this option. Default value is 0.
If set to 2, will set frame timestamp to the modification time of the image file in
nanosecond precision.

=item B<video_size>

Set the video size of the images to read. If not specified the video
size is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=item B<export_path_metadata>

If set to 1, will add two extra fields to the metadata found in input, making them
also available for other filters (see I<drawtext> filter for examples). Default
value is 0. The extra fields are described below:

=over 4


=item B<lavf.image2dec.source_path>

Corresponds to the full path to the input file being read.

=item B<lavf.image2dec.source_basename>

Corresponds to the name of the file being read.

=over 4


=item B<enable_drefs>

Enable loading of external tracks, disabled by default.
Enabling this can theoretically leak information in some use cases.


=item B<use_absolute_path>

Allows loading of external tracks via absolute paths, disabled by default.
Enabling this poses a security risk. It should only be enabled if the source
is known to be non-malicious.


=item B<seek_streams_individually>

When seeking, identify the closest point in each stream individually and demux packets in
that stream from identified point. This can lead to a different sequence of packets compared
to demuxing linearly from the beginning. Default is true.

Ignore any edit list atoms. The demuxer, by default, modifies the stream index to reflect the
timeline described by the edit list. Default is false.


=item B<advanced_editlist>

Modify the stream index to reflect the timeline described by the edit list. C<ignore_editlist>
must be set to false for this option to be effective.

streams move to different PIDs. Default value is 0.

=back



=head2 mpjpeg


MJPEG encapsulated in multi-part MIME demuxer.

This demuxer allows reading of MJPEG, where each frame is represented as a part of
multipart/x-mixed-replace stream.

=over 4



=item B<strict_mime_boundary>

Default implementation applies a relaxed standard to multi-part MIME boundary detection,
to prevent regression with numerous existing endpoints not generating a proper MIME
MJPEG stream. Turning this option on by setting it to 1 will result in a stricter check
of the boundary value.

=back



=head2 rawvideo


Raw video demuxer.

This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there is no header
specifying the assumed video parameters, the user must specify them
in order to be able to decode the data correctly.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4



=item B<framerate>

Set input video frame rate. Default value is 25.


=item B<pixel_format>

Set the input video pixel format. Default value is C<yuv420p>.


=item B<video_size>

Set the input video size. This value must be specified explicitly.

=back


For example to read a rawvideo file F<input.raw> with
B<ffplay>, assuming a pixel format of C<rgb24>, a video
size of C<320x240>, and a frame rate of 10 images per second, use
the command:
	
	ffplay -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 320x240 -framerate 10 input.raw



=head2 sbg


SBaGen script demuxer.

This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
E<lt>B<http://uazu.net/sbagen/>E<gt> to generate binaural beats sessions. A SBG
script looks like that:
	
	-SE
	a: 300-2.5/3 440+4.5/0
	b: 300-2.5/0 440+4.5/3
	off: -
	NOW      == a
	+0:07:00 == b
	+0:14:00 == a
	+0:21:00 == b
	+0:30:00    off


A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the I<NOW> reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.


=head2 tedcaptions


JSON captions used for E<lt>B<http://www.ted.com/>E<gt>.

TED does not provide links to the captions, but they can be guessed from the
page. The file F<tools/bookmarklets.html> from the FFmpeg source tree
contains a bookmarklet to expose them.

This demuxer accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<start_time>

Set the start time of the TED talk, in milliseconds. The default is 15000
(15s). It is used to sync the captions with the downloadable videos, because
they include a 15s intro.

=back


Example: convert the captions to a format most players understand:
	
	ffmpeg -i http://www.ted.com/talks/subtitles/id/1/lang/en talk1-en.srt



=head2 vapoursynth


Vapoursynth wrapper.

Due to security concerns, Vapoursynth scripts will not
be autodetected so the input format has to be forced. For ff* CLI tools,
add C<-f vapoursynth> before the input C<-i yourscript.vpy>.

This demuxer accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<max_script_size>

The demuxer buffers the entire script into memory. Adjust this value to set the maximum buffer size,
which in turn, acts as a ceiling for the size of scripts that can be read.
Default is 1 MiB.

=back



=head1 METADATA


FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF-8-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.

The file format is as follows:

=over 4



=item 1.

A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.


=item 2.

The header is a B<;FFMETADATA> string, followed by a version number (now 1).


=item 3.

Metadata tags are of the form B<key=value>


=item 4.

Immediately after header follows global metadata


=item 5.

After global metadata there may be sections with per-stream/per-chapter
metadata.


=item 6.

A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. STREAM or CHAPTER) in
brackets (B<[>, B<]>) and ends with next section or end of file.


=item 7.

At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form
B<TIMEBASE=>I<num>B</>I<den>, where I<num> and I<den> are
integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in nanoseconds.

Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
B<START=>I<num>, B<END=>I<num>, where I<num> is a positive
integer.


=item 8.

Empty lines and lines starting with B<;> or B<#> are ignored.


=item 9.

Metadata keys or values containing special characters (B<=>, B<;>,
B<#>, B<\> and a newline) must be escaped with a backslash B<\>.


=item 10.

Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. B<foo = bar>) is considered to be
a part of the tag (in the example above key is B<foo> , value is
 B<bar>).

=back


A ffmetadata file might look like this:
	
	;FFMETADATA1
	title=bike\\shed
	;this is a comment
	artist=FFmpeg troll team
	
	[CHAPTER]
	TIMEBASE=1/1000
	START=0
	#chapter ends at 0:01:00
	END=60000
	title=chapter \#1
	[STREAM]
	title=multi\
	line


By using the ffmetadata muxer and demuxer it is possible to extract
metadata from an input file to an ffmetadata file, and then transcode
the file into an output file with the edited ffmetadata file.

Extracting an ffmetadata file with F<ffmpeg> goes as follows:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f ffmetadata FFMETADATAFILE


Reinserting edited metadata information from the FFMETADATAFILE file can
be done as:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -i FFMETADATAFILE -map_metadata 1 -codec copy OUTPUT



=head1 PROTOCOL OPTIONS


The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the protocols. In addition each protocol may support
so-called private options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<protocol_whitelist> I<list> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set a ","-separated list of allowed protocols. "ALL" matches all protocols. Protocols
prefixed by "-" are disabled.
All protocols are allowed by default but protocols used by an another
protocol (nested protocols) are restricted to a per protocol subset.

=back




=head1 PROTOCOLS


Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg that enable access to
resources that require specific protocols.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-protocols".

You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
"--disable-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using the
option "--enable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>", or you can disable a
particular protocol using the option
"--disable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>".

The option "-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported protocols.

All protocols accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<rw_timeout>

Maximum time to wait for (network) read/write operations to complete,
in microseconds.

=back


A description of the currently available protocols follows.


=head2 amqp


Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) version 0-9-1 is a broker based
publish-subscribe communication protocol.

FFmpeg must be compiled with --enable-librabbitmq to support AMQP. A separate
AMQP broker must also be run. An example open-source AMQP broker is RabbitMQ.

After starting the broker, an FFmpeg client may stream data to the broker using
the command:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]


Where hostname and port (default is 5672) is the address of the broker. The
client may also set a user/password for authentication. The default for both
fields is "guest". Name of virtual host on broker can be set with vhost. The
default value is "/".

Muliple subscribers may stream from the broker using the command:
	
	ffplay amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]


In RabbitMQ all data published to the broker flows through a specific exchange,
and each subscribing client has an assigned queue/buffer. When a packet arrives
at an exchange, it may be copied to a client's queue depending on the exchange
and routing_key fields.

The following options are supported:


=over 4



=item B<exchange>

Sets the exchange to use on the broker. RabbitMQ has several predefined
exchanges: "amq.direct" is the default exchange, where the publisher and
subscriber must have a matching routing_key; "amq.fanout" is the same as a
broadcast operation (i.e. the data is forwarded to all queues on the fanout
exchange independent of the routing_key); and "amq.topic" is similar to
"amq.direct", but allows for more complex pattern matching (refer to the RabbitMQ
documentation).


=item B<routing_key>

Sets the routing key. The default value is "amqp". The routing key is used on
the "amq.direct" and "amq.topic" exchanges to decide whether packets are written
to the queue of a subscriber.


=item B<pkt_size>

Maximum size of each packet sent/received to the broker. Default is 131072.
Minimum is 4096 and max is any large value (representable by an int). When
receiving packets, this sets an internal buffer size in FFmpeg. It should be
equal to or greater than the size of the published packets to the broker. Otherwise
the received message may be truncated causing decoding errors.


=item B<connection_timeout>

The timeout in seconds during the initial connection to the broker. The
default value is rw_timeout, or 5 seconds if rw_timeout is not set.


=item B<delivery_mode> I<mode>

Sets the delivery mode of each message sent to broker.
The following values are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<persistent>

Delivery mode set to "persistent" (2). This is the default value.
Messages may be written to the broker's disk depending on its setup.


=item B<non-persistent>

Delivery mode set to "non-persistent" (1).
Messages will stay in broker's memory unless the broker is under memory
pressure.


=back



=back



=head2 async


Asynchronous data filling wrapper for input stream.

Fill data in a background thread, to decouple I/O operation from demux thread.

	
	async:<URL>
	async:http://host/resource
	async:cache:http://host/resource



=head2 bluray


Read BluRay playlist.

The accepted options are:

=over 4



=item B<angle>

BluRay angle


=item B<chapter>

Start chapter (1...N)


=item B<playlist>

Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)


=back


Examples:

Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:
	
	bluray:/mnt/bluray


Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start from chapter 2:
	
	-playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray



=head2 cache


Caching wrapper for input stream.

Cache the input stream to temporary file. It brings seeking capability to live streams.

The accepted options are:

=over 4



=item B<read_ahead_limit>

Amount in bytes that may be read ahead when seeking isn't supported. Range is -1 to INT_MAX.
-1 for unlimited. Default is 65536.


=back


URL Syntax is
	
	cache:<URL>



=head2 concat


Physical concatenation protocol.

Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were
a unique resource.

A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
	
	concat:<URL1>|<URL2>|...|<URLN>


where I<URL1>, I<URL2>, ..., I<URLN> are the urls of the
resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct
protocol.

For example to read a sequence of files F<split1.mpeg>,
F<split2.mpeg>, F<split3.mpeg> with B<ffplay> use the
command:
	
	ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg


Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for
many shells.


=head2 crypto


AES-encrypted stream reading protocol.

The accepted options are:

=over 4


=item B<key>

Set the AES decryption key binary block from given hexadecimal representation.


=item B<iv>

Set the AES decryption initialization vector binary block from given hexadecimal representation.

=back


Accepted URL formats:
	
	crypto:<URL>
	crypto+<URL>



=head2 data


Data in-line in the URI. See E<lt>B<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme>E<gt>.

For example, to convert a GIF file given inline with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhCAAIAMIEAAAAAAAA//8AAP//AP///////////////ywAAAAACAAIAAADF0gEDLojDgdGiJdJqUX02iB4E8Q9jUMkADs=" smiley.png



=head2 file


File access protocol.

Read from or write to a file.

A file URL can have the form:
	
	file:<filename>


where I<filename> is the path of the file to read.

An URL that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed to be a
file URL. Depending on the build, an URL that looks like a Windows
path with the drive letter at the beginning will also be assumed to be
a file URL (usually not the case in builds for unix-like systems).

For example to read from a file F<input.mpeg> with B<ffmpeg>
use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<truncate>

Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of 0 prevents
truncating. Default value is 1.


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable for files on slow medium.


=item B<follow>

If set to 1, the protocol will retry reading at the end of the file, allowing
reading files that still are being written. In order for this to terminate,
you either need to use the rw_timeout option, or use the interrupt callback
(for API users).


=item B<seekable>

Controls if seekability is advertised on the file. 0 means non-seekable, -1
means auto (seekable for normal files, non-seekable for named pipes).

Many demuxers handle seekable and non-seekable resources differently,
overriding this might speed up opening certain files at the cost of losing some
features (e.g. accurate seeking).

=back



=head2 ftp


FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

Read from or write to remote resources using FTP protocol.

Following syntax is required.
	
	ftp://[user[:password]@]server[:port]/path/to/remote/resource.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<timeout>

Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to -1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.


=item B<ftp-user>

Set a user to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by the
user in the FTP URL.


=item B<ftp-password>

Set a password to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by
the password in the FTP URL, or by B<ftp-anonymous-password> if no user is set.


=item B<ftp-anonymous-password>

Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an e-mail address
should be used.


=item B<ftp-write-seekable>

Control seekability of connection during encoding. If set to 1 the
resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not
to be seekable. Default value is 0.

=back


NOTE: Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended to not do
it, unless special care is taken (tests, customized server configuration
etc.). Different FTP servers behave in different way during seek
operation. ff* tools may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.


=head2 gopher


Gopher protocol.


=head2 gophers


Gophers protocol.

The Gopher protocol with TLS encapsulation.


=head2 hls


Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as
a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be
remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using the standard
file protocol.
The nested protocol is declared by specifying
"+I<proto>" after the hls URI scheme name, where I<proto>
is either "file" or "http".

	
	hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
	hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8


Using this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work
just as well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.
To use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the
m3u8 files.


=head2 http


HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<seekable>

Control seekability of connection. If set to 1 the resource is
supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not to be seekable,
if set to -1 it will try to autodetect if it is seekable. Default
value is -1.


=item B<chunked_post>

If set to 1 use chunked Transfer-Encoding for posts, default is 1.


=item B<content_type>

Set a specific content type for the POST messages or for listen mode.


=item B<http_proxy>

set HTTP proxy to tunnel through e.g. http://example.com:1234


=item B<headers>

Set custom HTTP headers, can override built in default headers. The
value must be a string encoding the headers.


=item B<multiple_requests>

Use persistent connections if set to 1, default is 0.


=item B<post_data>

Set custom HTTP post data.


=item B<referer>

Set the Referer header. Include 'Referer: URL' header in HTTP request.


=item B<user_agent>

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the protocol will use a
string describing the libavformat build. ("Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>")


=item B<user-agent>

This is a deprecated option, you can use user_agent instead it.


=item B<reconnect_at_eof>

If set then eof is treated like an error and causes reconnection, this is useful
for live / endless streams.


=item B<reconnect_streamed>

If set then even streamed/non seekable streams will be reconnected on errors.


=item B<reconnect_on_network_error>

Reconnect automatically in case of TCP/TLS errors during connect.


=item B<reconnect_on_http_error>

A comma separated list of HTTP status codes to reconnect on. The list can
include specific status codes (e.g. '503') or the strings '4xx' / '5xx'.


=item B<reconnect_delay_max>

Sets the maximum delay in seconds after which to give up reconnecting


=item B<mime_type>

Export the MIME type.


=item B<http_version>

Exports the HTTP response version number. Usually "1.0" or "1.1".


=item B<icy>

If set to 1 request ICY (SHOUTcast) metadata from the server. If the server
supports this, the metadata has to be retrieved by the application by reading
the B<icy_metadata_headers> and B<icy_metadata_packet> options.
The default is 1.


=item B<icy_metadata_headers>

If the server supports ICY metadata, this contains the ICY-specific HTTP reply
headers, separated by newline characters.


=item B<icy_metadata_packet>

If the server supports ICY metadata, and B<icy> was set to 1, this
contains the last non-empty metadata packet sent by the server. It should be
polled in regular intervals by applications interested in mid-stream metadata
updates.


=item B<cookies>

Set the cookies to be sent in future requests. The format of each cookie is the
same as the value of a Set-Cookie HTTP response field. Multiple cookies can be
delimited by a newline character.


=item B<offset>

Set initial byte offset.


=item B<end_offset>

Try to limit the request to bytes preceding this offset.


=item B<method>

When used as a client option it sets the HTTP method for the request.

When used as a server option it sets the HTTP method that is going to be
expected from the client(s).
If the expected and the received HTTP method do not match the client will
be given a Bad Request response.
When unset the HTTP method is not checked for now. This will be replaced by
autodetection in the future.


=item B<listen>

If set to 1 enables experimental HTTP server. This can be used to send data when
used as an output option, or read data from a client with HTTP POST when used as
an input option.
If set to 2 enables experimental multi-client HTTP server. This is not yet implemented
in ffmpeg.c and thus must not be used as a command line option.
	
	# Server side (sending):
	ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -c copy -listen 1 -f ogg http://<server>:<port>
	
	# Client side (receiving):
	ffmpeg -i http://<server>:<port> -c copy somefile.ogg
	
	# Client can also be done with wget:
	wget http://<server>:<port> -O somefile.ogg
	
	# Server side (receiving):
	ffmpeg -listen 1 -i http://<server>:<port> -c copy somefile.ogg
	
	# Client side (sending):
	ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -chunked_post 0 -c copy -f ogg http://<server>:<port>
	
	# Client can also be done with wget:
	wget --post-file=somefile.ogg http://<server>:<port>



=item B<send_expect_100>

Send an Expect: 100-continue header for POST. If set to 1 it will send, if set
to 0 it won't, if set to -1 it will try to send if it is applicable. Default
value is -1.


=item B<auth_type>


Set HTTP authentication type. No option for Digest, since this method requires
getting nonce parameters from the server first and can't be used straight away like
Basic.


=over 4


=item B<none>

Choose the HTTP authentication type automatically. This is the default.

=item B<basic>


Choose the HTTP basic authentication.

Basic authentication sends a Base64-encoded string that contains a user name and password
for the client. Base64 is not a form of encryption and should be considered the same as
sending the user name and password in clear text (Base64 is a reversible encoding).
If a resource needs to be protected, strongly consider using an authentication scheme
other than basic authentication. HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication.
Without these additional security enhancements, basic authentication should not be used
to protect sensitive or valuable information.

=back



=back



=head3 HTTP Cookies


Some HTTP requests will be denied unless cookie values are passed in with the
request. The B<cookies> option allows these cookies to be specified. At
the very least, each cookie must specify a value along with a path and domain.
HTTP requests that match both the domain and path will automatically include the
cookie value in the HTTP Cookie header field. Multiple cookies can be delimited
by a newline.

The required syntax to play a stream specifying a cookie is:
	
	ffplay -cookies "nlqptid=nltid=tsn; path=/; domain=somedomain.com;" http://somedomain.com/somestream.m3u8



=head2 Icecast


Icecast protocol (stream to Icecast servers)

This protocol accepts the following options:

Set the stream genre.


=item B<ice_name>

Set the stream name.


=item B<ice_description>

Set the stream description.


=item B<ice_url>

Set the stream website URL.


=item B<ice_public>

Set if the stream should be public.
The default is 0 (not public).


=item B<user_agent>

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified a string of the form
"Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>" will be used.


=item B<password>

Set the Icecast mountpoint password.


=item B<content_type>

Set the stream content type. This must be set if it is different from
audio/mpeg.


=item B<legacy_icecast>

This enables support for Icecast versions E<lt> 2.4.0, that do not support the
HTTP PUT method but the SOURCE method.


=item B<tls>

Establish a TLS (HTTPS) connection to Icecast.


=back


	
	icecast://[<username>[:<password>]@]<server>:<port>/<mountpoint>



=head2 mmst


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.


=head2 mmsh


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

The required syntax is:
	
	mmsh://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>]



=head2 md5


MD5 output protocol.

Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes
this to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can
be used to test muxers without writing an actual file.

Some examples follow.
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:


Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.


=head2 pipe


UNIX pipe access protocol.

Read and write from UNIX pipes.

The accepted syntax is:
	
	pipe:[<number>]


I<number> is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the
pipe (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If I<number>
is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used
for writing, stdin for reading.

For example to read from stdin with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
	# ...this is the same as...
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:


For writing to stdout with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat > test.avi
	# ...this is the same as...
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.

=back


Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.


=head2 prompeg


Pro-MPEG Code of Practice #3 Release 2 FEC protocol.

The Pro-MPEG CoP#3 FEC is a 2D parity-check forward error correction mechanism
for MPEG-2 Transport Streams sent over RTP.

This protocol must be used in conjunction with the C<rtp_mpegts> muxer and
the C<rtp> protocol.

The required syntax is:
	
	-f rtp_mpegts -fec prompeg=<option>=<val>... rtp://<hostname>:<port>


The destination UDP ports are C<port + 2> for the column FEC stream
and C<port + 4> for the row FEC stream.

It is the name of the application to access. It usually corresponds to
the path where the application is installed on the RTMP server
(e.g. F</ondemand/>, F</flash/live/>, etc.). You can override
the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_app> option, too.


=item B<playpath>

=head2 librtmp rtmp, rtmpe, rtmps, rtmpt, rtmpte


Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through
librtmp.

Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
"--enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace the native RTMP
protocol.

This protocol provides most client functions and a few server
functions needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT),
encrypted RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled
variants of these encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

The required syntax is:
	
	<rtmp_proto>://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>] <options>


where I<rtmp_proto> is one of the strings "rtmp", "rtmpt", "rtmpe",
"rtmps", "rtmpte", "rtmpts" corresponding to each RTMP variant, and
I<server>, I<port>, I<app> and I<playpath> have the same
meaning as specified for the RTMP native protocol.
I<options> contains a list of space-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using
B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i myfile -f flv rtmp://myserver/live/mystream


To play the same stream using B<ffplay>:
	
	ffplay "rtmp://myserver/live/mystream live=1"



=head2 rtp


Real-time Transport Protocol.

The required syntax for an RTP URL is:
rtp://I<hostname>[:I<port>][?I<option>=I<val>...]

I<port> specifies the RTP port to use.

The following URL options are supported:


=over 4



=item B<ttl=>I<n>

=item B<rtcpport=>I<n>

Set the remote RTCP port to I<n>.


=item B<localrtpport=>I<n>

Set the local RTP port to I<n>.


=item B<localrtcpport=>I<n>B<'>

=item B<localport=>I<n>

Set the local RTP port to I<n>.


=item B<timeout=>I<n>

Set timeout (in microseconds) of socket I/O operations to I<n>.

This is a deprecated option. Instead, B<localrtpport> should be
used.


=back


Important notes:


=over 4



=item 1.

If B<rtcpport> is not set the RTCP port will be set to the RTP
port value plus 1.


=item 2.

If B<localrtpport> (the local RTP port) is not set any available
port will be used for the local RTP and RTCP ports.


=item 3.

If B<localrtcpport> (the local RTCP port) is not set it will be
set to the local RTP port value plus 1.

=back



=head2 rtsp


Real-Time Streaming Protocol.

RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a demuxer
and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data transferred
over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and Real-RTSP (with
data transferred over RDT).

The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock's
E<lt>B<https://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server>E<gt>).

The required syntax for a RTSP url is:
	
	rtsp://<hostname>[:<port>]/<path>


Options can be set on the B<ffmpeg>/B<ffplay> command
line, or set in code via C<AVOption>s or in
C<avformat_open_input>.

The following options are supported.


=over 4


=item B<initial_pause>

Do not start playing the stream immediately if set to 1. Default value
is 0.


=item B<rtsp_transport>

Set RTSP transport protocols.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<udp>

Use UDP as lower transport protocol.


=item B<tcp>

Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower
transport protocol.


=item B<udp_multicast>

Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.


=item B<http>

Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for
passing proxies.

=back


Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they are
tried one at a time (if the setup of one fails, the next one is tried).
For the muxer, only the B<tcp> and B<udp> options are supported.


=item B<rtsp_flags>

Set RTSP flags.

The following values are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<filter_src>

Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

=item B<listen>

Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

=item B<prefer_tcp>

Try TCP for RTP transport first, if TCP is available as RTSP RTP transport.

=back


Default value is B<none>.


=item B<allowed_media_types>

Set media types to accept from the server.

The following flags are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<video>


=item B<audio>


=item B<data>


=back


By default it accepts all media types.


=item B<min_port>

Set minimum local UDP port. Default value is 5000.


=item B<max_port>

Set maximum local UDP port. Default value is 65000.


=item B<timeout>

Set maximum timeout (in seconds) to wait for incoming connections.

A value of -1 means infinite (default). This option implies the
B<rtsp_flags> set to B<listen>.


=item B<reorder_queue_size>

Set number of packets to buffer for handling of reordered packets.


=item B<stimeout>

Set socket TCP I/O timeout in microseconds.


=item B<user-agent>

Override User-Agent header. If not specified, it defaults to the
libavformat identifier string.

=back


When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received packets
(since they may arrive out of order, or packets may get lost totally). This
can be disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to zero (via
the C<max_delay> field of AVFormatContext).

When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with B<ffplay>, the
streams to display can be chosen with C<-vst> I<n> and
C<-ast> I<n> for video and audio respectively, and can be switched
on the fly by pressing C<v> and C<a>.


=head3 Examples


The following examples all make use of the B<ffplay> and
B<ffmpeg> tools.


=over 4


=item *

Watch a stream over UDP, with a max reordering delay of 0.5 seconds:
	
	ffplay -max_delay 500000 -rtsp_transport udp rtsp://server/video.mp4



=item *

Watch a stream tunneled over HTTP:
	
	ffplay -rtsp_transport http rtsp://server/video.mp4



=item *

Send a stream in realtime to a RTSP server, for others to watch:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f rtsp -muxdelay 0.1 rtsp://server/live.sdp



=item *

Receive a stream in realtime:
	
	ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp <output>

=head2 sap


Session Announcement Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a
protocol handler in libavformat, it is a muxer and demuxer.
It is used for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the
streams regularly on a separate port.


=head3 Muxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:
	
	sap://<destination>[:<port>][?<options>]


The RTP packets are sent to I<destination> on port I<port>,
or to port 5004 if no port is specified.
I<options> is a C<&>-separated list. The following options
are supported:


=over 4



=item B<announce_addr=>I<address>

Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements to.
If omitted, the announcements are sent to the commonly used SAP
announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or
ff0e::2:7ffe if I<destination> is an IPv6 address.


=item B<announce_port=>I<port>

Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to
9875 if not specified.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP packets,
defaults to 255.


=item B<same_port=>I<0|1>

If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero (the
default), all streams are sent on unique ports, with each stream on a
port 2 numbers higher than the previous.
VLC/Live555 requires this to be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.
The RTP stack in libavformat for receiving requires all streams to be sent
on unique ports.

=back


Example command lines follow.

To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1


Similarly, for watching in B<ffplay>:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255


And for watching in B<ffplay>, over IPv6:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]



=head3 Demuxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:
	
	sap://[<address>][:<port>]


I<address> is the multicast address to listen for announcements on,
if omitted, the default 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net) is used. I<port>
is the port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

The demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.
Once an announcement is received, it tries to receive that particular stream.

Example command lines follow.

To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://


To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]

(2 handshake exchanges) with the default connect timeout of
3 seconds. This option applies to the caller and rendezvous
connection modes. The connect timeout is 10 times the value
set for the rendezvous mode (which can be used as a
workaround for this connection problem with earlier versions).


=item B<ffs=>I<bytes>

Flight Flag Size (Window Size), in bytes. FFS is actually an
internal parameter and you should set it to not less than
B<recv_buffer_size> and B<mss>. The default value
is relatively large, therefore unless you set a very large receiver buffer,
you do not need to change this option. Default value is 25600.


=item B<inputbw=>I<bytes/seconds>

Sender nominal input rate, in bytes per seconds. Used along with
B<oheadbw>, when B<maxbw> is set to relative (0), to
calculate maximum sending rate when recovery packets are sent
along with the main media stream:
B<inputbw> * (100 + B<oheadbw>) / 100
if B<inputbw> is not set while B<maxbw> is set to
relative (0), the actual input rate is evaluated inside
the library. Default value is 0.


=item B<iptos=>I<tos>

IP Type of Service. Applies to sender only. Default value is 0xB8.


=item B<ipttl=>I<ttl>

IP Time To Live. Applies to sender only. Default value is 64.


=item B<latency=>I<microseconds>

Timestamp-based Packet Delivery Delay.
Used to absorb bursts of missed packet retransmissions.
This flag sets both B<rcvlatency> and B<peerlatency>
to the same value. Note that prior to version 1.3.0
this is the only flag to set the latency, however
this is effectively equivalent to setting B<peerlatency>,
when side is sender and B<rcvlatency>
when side is receiver, and the bidirectional stream
sending is not supported.


=item B<listen_timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set socket listen timeout.


=item B<maxbw=>I<bytes/seconds>

Maximum sending bandwidth, in bytes per seconds.
-1 infinite (CSRTCC limit is 30mbps)
0 relative to input rate (see B<inputbw>)
E<gt>0 absolute limit value
Default value is 0 (relative)


=item B<mode=>I<caller|listener|rendezvous>

Connection mode.
B<caller> opens client connection.
B<listener> starts server to listen for incoming connections.
B<rendezvous> use Rendez-Vous connection mode.
Default value is caller.


=item B<mss=>I<bytes>

Maximum Segment Size, in bytes. Used for buffer allocation
and rate calculation using a packet counter assuming fully
filled packets. The smallest MSS between the peers is
used. This is 1500 by default in the overall internet.
This is the maximum size of the UDP packet and can be
only decreased, unless you have some unusual dedicated
network settings. Default value is 1500.


=item B<nakreport=>I<1|0>

If set to 1, Receiver will send `UMSG_LOSSREPORT` messages
periodically until a lost packet is retransmitted or
intentionally dropped. Default value is 1.


=item B<oheadbw=>I<percents>

Recovery bandwidth overhead above input rate, in percents.
See B<inputbw>. Default value is 25%.


=item B<passphrase=>I<string>

HaiCrypt Encryption/Decryption Passphrase string, length
from 10 to 79 characters. The passphrase is the shared
secret between the sender and the receiver. It is used
to generate the Key Encrypting Key using PBKDF2
(Password-Based Key Derivation Function). It is used
only if B<pbkeylen> is non-zero. It is used on
the receiver only if the received data is encrypted.
The configured passphrase cannot be recovered (write-only).


=item B<enforced_encryption=>I<1|0>

If true, both connection parties must have the same password
set (including empty, that is, with no encryption). If the
password doesn't match or only one side is unencrypted,
the connection is rejected. Default is true.


=item B<kmrefreshrate=>I<packets>

The number of packets to be transmitted after which the
encryption key is switched to a new key. Default is -1.
-1 means auto (0x1000000 in srt library). The range for
this option is integers in the 0 - C<INT_MAX>.


=item B<kmpreannounce=>I<packets>

The interval between when a new encryption key is sent and
when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the
subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and
when the old encryption key is decommissioned. Default is -1.
-1 means auto (0x1000 in srt library). The range for
this option is integers in the 0 - C<INT_MAX>.


=item B<payload_size=>I<bytes>

Sets the maximum declared size of a packet transferred
during the single call to the sending function in Live
mode. Use 0 if this value isn't used (which is default in
file mode).
Default is -1 (automatic), which typically means MPEG-TS;
if you are going to use SRT
to send any different kind of payload, such as, for example,
wrapping a live stream in very small frames, then you can
use a bigger maximum frame size, though not greater than
1456 bytes.


=item B<pkt_size=>I<bytes>

Alias for B<payload_size>.


=item B<peerlatency=>I<microseconds>

The latency value (as described in B<rcvlatency>) that is
set by the sender side as a minimum value for the receiver.


=item B<pbkeylen=>I<bytes>

Sender encryption key length, in bytes.
Only can be set to 0, 16, 24 and 32.
Enable sender encryption if not 0.
Not required on receiver (set to 0),
key size obtained from sender in HaiCrypt handshake.
Default value is 0.


=item B<rcvlatency=>I<microseconds>

The time that should elapse since the moment when the
packet was sent and the moment when it's delivered to
the receiver application in the receiving function.
This time should be a buffer time large enough to cover
the time spent for sending, unexpectedly extended RTT
time, and the time needed to retransmit the lost UDP
packet. The effective latency value will be the maximum
of this options' value and the value of B<peerlatency>
set by the peer side. Before version 1.3.0 this option
is only available as B<latency>.


=item B<recv_buffer_size=>I<bytes>

Set UDP receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.


=item B<send_buffer_size=>I<bytes>

Set UDP send buffer size, expressed in bytes.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeouts for read, write and connect operations. Note that the
SRT library has internal timeouts which can be controlled separately, the
value set here is only a cap on those.


=item B<tlpktdrop=>I<1|0>

Too-late Packet Drop. When enabled on receiver, it skips
missing packets that have not been delivered in time and
delivers the following packets to the application when
their time-to-play has come. It also sends a fake ACK to
the sender. When enabled on sender and enabled on the
receiving peer, the sender drops the older packets that
have no chance of being delivered in time. It was
automatically enabled in the sender if the receiver
supports it.


=item B<sndbuf=>I<bytes>

Set send buffer size, expressed in bytes.


=item B<rcvbuf=>I<bytes>

Set receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.

Receive buffer must not be greater than B<ffs>.


=item B<lossmaxttl=>I<packets>

The value up to which the Reorder Tolerance may grow. When
Reorder Tolerance is E<gt> 0, then packet loss report is delayed
until that number of packets come in. Reorder Tolerance
increases every time a "belated" packet has come, but it
wasn't due to retransmission (that is, when UDP packets tend
to come out of order), with the difference between the latest
sequence and this packet's sequence, and not more than the
value of this option. By default it's 0, which means that this
mechanism is turned off, and the loss report is always sent
immediately upon experiencing a "gap" in sequences.


=item B<minversion>

The minimum SRT version that is required from the peer. A connection
to a peer that does not satisfy the minimum version requirement
will be rejected.

The version format in hex is 0xXXYYZZ for x.y.z in human readable
form.


=item B<streamid=>I<string>

A string limited to 512 characters that can be set on the socket prior
to connecting. This stream ID will be able to be retrieved by the
listener side from the socket that is returned from srt_accept and
was connected by a socket with that set stream ID. SRT does not enforce
any special interpretation of the contents of this string.
This option doesn’t make sense in Rendezvous connection; the result
might be that simply one side will override the value from the other
side and it’s the matter of luck which one would win


=item B<smoother=>I<live|file>

The type of Smoother used for the transmission for that socket, which
is responsible for the transmission and congestion control. The Smoother
type must be exactly the same on both connecting parties, otherwise
the connection is rejected.


=item B<messageapi=>I<1|0>

When set, this socket uses the Message API, otherwise it uses Buffer
API. Note that in live mode (see B<transtype>) there’s only
message API available. In File mode you can chose to use one of two modes:

Stream API (default, when this option is false). In this mode you may
send as many data as you wish with one sending instruction, or even use
dedicated functions that read directly from a file. The internal facility
will take care of any speed and congestion control. When receiving, you
can also receive as many data as desired, the data not extracted will be
waiting for the next call. There is no boundary between data portions in
the Stream mode.

Message API. In this mode your single sending instruction passes exactly
one piece of data that has boundaries (a message). Contrary to Live mode,
this message may span across multiple UDP packets and the only size
limitation is that it shall fit as a whole in the sending buffer. The
receiver shall use as large buffer as necessary to receive the message,
otherwise the message will not be given up. When the message is not
complete (not all packets received or there was a packet loss) it will
not be given up.


=item B<transtype=>I<live|file>

Sets the transmission type for the socket, in particular, setting this
option sets multiple other parameters to their default values as required
for a particular transmission type.

live: Set options as for live transmission. In this mode, you should
send by one sending instruction only so many data that fit in one UDP packet,
and limited to the value defined first in B<payload_size> (1316 is
default in this mode). There is no speed control in this mode, only the
bandwidth control, if configured, in order to not exceed the bandwidth with
the overhead transmission (retransmitted and control packets).

file: Set options as for non-live transmission. See B<messageapi>
for further explanations


=item B<linger=>I<seconds>

The number of seconds that the socket waits for unsent data when closing.
Default is -1. -1 means auto (off with 0 seconds in live mode, on with 180
seconds in file mode). The range for this option is integers in the
0 - C<INT_MAX>.

I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<listen=>I<2|1|0>

Listen for an incoming connection. 0 disables listen, 1 enables listen in
single client mode, 2 enables listen in multi-client mode. Default value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<listen_timeout=>I<milliseconds>

=head2 tls


Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:
	
	tls://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


The following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):


=over 4



=item B<ca_file, cafile=>I<filename>

A file containing certificate authority (CA) root certificates to treat
as trusted. If the linked TLS library contains a default this might not
need to be specified for verification to work, but not all libraries and
setups have defaults built in.
The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.


=item B<tls_verify=>I<1|0>

If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are communicating with.
Note, if using OpenSSL, this currently only makes sure that the
peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in the CA
database, but it does not validate that the certificate actually
matches the host name we are trying to connect to. (With other backends,
the host name is validated as well.)

This is disabled by default since it requires a CA database to be
provided by the caller in many cases.


=item B<cert_file, cert=>I<filename>

A file containing a certificate to use in the handshake with the peer.
(When operating as server, in listen mode, this is more often required
by the peer, while client certificates only are mandated in certain
setups.)


=item B<key_file, key=>I<filename>

A file containing the private key for the certificate.


=item B<listen=>I<1|0>

If enabled, listen for connections on the provided port, and assume
the server role in the handshake instead of the client role.


=item B<http_proxy>

The HTTP proxy to tunnel through, e.g. C<http://example.com:1234>.
The proxy must support the CONNECT method.


=back


Example command lines:

To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tls://<hostname>:<port>?listen&cert=<server.crt>&key=<server.key>


To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using B<ffplay>:

	
	ffplay tls://<hostname>:<port>



=head2 udp


User Datagram Protocol.

The required syntax for an UDP URL is:
	
	udp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form I<key>=I<val>.

In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
to store the incoming data, which allows one to reduce loss of data due to
UDP socket buffer overruns. The I<fifo_size> and
I<overrun_nonfatal> options are related to this buffer.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<buffer_size=>I<size>

Set the UDP maximum socket buffer size in bytes. This is used to set either
the receive or send buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.
Default is 32 KB for output, 384 KB for input.  See also I<fifo_size>.


=item B<bitrate=>I<bitrate>

If set to nonzero, the output will have the specified constant bitrate if the
input has enough packets to sustain it.


=item B<burst_bits=>I<bits>

When using I<bitrate> this specifies the maximum number of bits in
packet bursts.


=item B<localport=>I<port>

Override the local UDP port to bind with.


=item B<localaddr=>I<addr>

Local IP address of a network interface used for sending packets or joining
multicast groups.


=item B<pkt_size=>I<size>

Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.


=item B<reuse=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Set the time to live value (for multicast only).


=item B<connect=>I<1|0>

Initialize the UDP socket with C<connect()>. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination
unreachable" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.


=item B<sources=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Only receive packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast,
also subscribe to multicast traffic coming from these addresses only.


=item B<block=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Ignore packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast, also
exclude the source addresses in the multicast subscription.


=item B<fifo_size=>I<units>

Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.


=item B<overrun_nonfatal=>I<1|0>

Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default
value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<broadcast=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow UDP broadcasting.

Note that broadcasting may not work properly on networks having
a broadcast storm protection.

	unix://<filepath>


The following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):


=over 4


=item B<timeout>

Timeout in ms.

=item B<listen>

Create the Unix socket in listening mode.

=back



=head2 zmq


ZeroMQ asynchronous messaging using the libzmq library.

This library supports unicast streaming to multiple clients without relying on
an external server.

The required syntax for streaming or connecting to a stream is:
	
	zmq:tcp://ip-address:port


Example:
Create a localhost stream on port 5555:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555


Multiple clients may connect to the stream using:
	
	ffplay zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555


Streaming to multiple clients is implemented using a ZeroMQ Pub-Sub pattern.
The server side binds to a port and publishes data. Clients connect to the
server (via IP address/port) and subscribe to the stream. The order in which
the server and client start generally does not matter.

ffmpeg must be compiled with the --enable-libzmq option to support
this protocol.

Options can be set on the B<ffmpeg>/B<ffplay> command
line. The following options are supported:


=over 4



=item B<pkt_size>

Forces the maximum packet size for sending/receiving data. The default value is
131,072 bytes. On the server side, this sets the maximum size of sent packets
via ZeroMQ. On the clients, it sets an internal buffer size for receiving
packets. Note that pkt_size on the clients should be equal to or greater than
pkt_size on the server. Otherwise the received message may be truncated causing
decoding errors.


=back




=head1 DEVICE OPTIONS


The libavdevice library provides the same interface as
libavformat. Namely, an input device is considered like a demuxer, and
an output device like a muxer, and the interface and generic device
options are the same provided by libavformat (see the ffmpeg-formats
manual).

In addition each input or output device may support so-called private
options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the device
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.



=head1 INPUT DEVICES


Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which enable accessing
the data coming from a multimedia device attached to your system.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-indevs".

You can disable all the input devices using the configure option
"--disable-indevs", and selectively enable an input device using the
option "--enable-indev=I<INDEV>", or you can disable a particular
input device using the option "--disable-indev=I<INDEV>".

The option "-devices" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported input devices.

A description of the currently available input devices follows.


=head2 alsa


ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound
installed on your system.

This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the
device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

An ALSA identifier has the syntax:
	
	hw:<CARD>[,<DEV>[,<SUBDEV>]]


where the I<DEV> and I<SUBDEV> components are optional.

The three arguments (in order: I<CARD>,I<DEV>,I<SUBDEV>)
specify card number or identifier, device number and subdevice number
(-1 means any).

To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the
files F</proc/asound/cards> and F</proc/asound/devices>.

For example to capture with B<ffmpeg> from an ALSA device with
card id 0, you may run the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav

android_camera is autodetected during configuration.

This device allows capturing from all cameras on an Android device,
which are integrated into the Camera2 NDK API.

The available cameras are enumerated internally and can be selected

=head2 avfoundation


AVFoundation input device.

AVFoundation is the currently recommended framework by Apple for streamgrabbing on OSX E<gt>= 10.7 as well as on iOS.

The input filename has to be given in the following syntax:
	
	-i "[[VIDEO]:[AUDIO]]"

The first entry selects the video input while the latter selects the audio input.
The stream has to be specified by the device name or the device index as shown by the device list.
Alternatively, the video and/or audio input device can be chosen by index using the

    B<-video_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

and/or

    B<-audio_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

, overriding any
device name or index given in the input filename.

All available devices can be enumerated by using B<-list_devices true>, listing
all device names and corresponding indices.

There are two device name aliases:

=over 4



=item C<default>

Select the AVFoundation default device of the corresponding type.


=item C<none>

Do not record the corresponding media type.
This is equivalent to specifying an empty device name or index.

=head3 Options


AVFoundation supports the following options:


=over 4



=item B<-list_devices E<lt>TRUE|FALSEE<gt>>

If set to true, a list of all available input devices is given showing all
device names and indices.


=item B<-video_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

Specify the video device by its index. Overrides anything given in the input filename.


=item B<-audio_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

Specify the audio device by its index. Overrides anything given in the input filename.


=item B<-pixel_format E<lt>FORMATE<gt>>

Request the video device to use a specific pixel format.
If the specified format is not supported, a list of available formats is given
and the first one in this list is used instead. Available pixel formats are:
C<monob, rgb555be, rgb555le, rgb565be, rgb565le, rgb24, bgr24, 0rgb, bgr0, 0bgr, rgb0,
 bgr48be, uyvy422, yuva444p, yuva444p16le, yuv444p, yuv422p16, yuv422p10, yuv444p10,
 yuv420p, nv12, yuyv422, gray>


=item B<-framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default is C<ntsc>, corresponding to a
frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<-video_size>

Set the video frame size.


=item B<-capture_cursor>

Capture the mouse pointer. Default is 0.


=item B<-capture_mouse_clicks>

Capture the screen mouse clicks. Default is 0.


=item B<-capture_raw_data>

Capture the raw device data. Default is 0.
Using this option may result in receiving the underlying data delivered to the AVFoundation framework. E.g. for muxed devices that sends raw DV data to the framework (like tape-based camcorders), setting this option to false results in extracted video frames captured in the designated pixel format only. Setting this option to true results in receiving the raw DV stream untouched.

=head2 decklink


The decklink input device provides capture capabilities for Blackmagic
DeckLink devices.

To enable this input device, you need the Blackmagic DeckLink SDK and you
need to configure with the appropriate C<--extra-cflags>
and C<--extra-ldflags>.
On Windows, you need to run the IDL files through B<widl>.

DeckLink is very picky about the formats it supports. Pixel format of the
input can be set with B<raw_format>.
Framerate and video size must be determined for your device with
B<-list_formats 1>. Audio sample rate is always 48 kHz and the number
of channels can be 2, 8 or 16. Note that all audio channels are bundled in one single
audio track.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<list_devices>

If set to B<true>, print a list of devices and exit.
Defaults to B<false>. This option is deprecated, please use the
C<-sources> option of ffmpeg to list the available input devices.


=item B<list_formats>

If set to B<true>, print a list of supported formats and exit.
Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<format_code E<lt>FourCCE<gt>>

This sets the input video format to the format given by the FourCC. To see
the supported values of your device(s) use B<list_formats>.
Note that there is a FourCC B<'pal '> that can also be used
as B<pal> (3 letters).
Default behavior is autodetection of the input video format, if the hardware
supports it.


=item B<raw_format>

Set the pixel format of the captured video.
Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<auto>


This is the default which means 8-bit YUV 422 or 8-bit ARGB if format
autodetection is used, 8-bit YUV 422 otherwise.

=back



=item B<teletext_lines>

If set to nonzero, an additional teletext stream will be captured from the
vertical ancillary data. Both SD PAL (576i) and HD (1080i or 1080p)
sources are supported. In case of HD sources, OP47 packets are decoded.

This option is a bitmask of the SD PAL VBI lines captured, specifically lines 6
to 22, and lines 318 to 335. Line 6 is the LSB in the mask. Selected lines
which do not contain teletext information will be ignored. You can use the
special B<all> constant to select all possible lines, or
B<standard> to skip lines 6, 318 and 319, which are not compatible with
all receivers.

For SD sources, ffmpeg needs to be compiled with C<--enable-libzvbi>. For
HD sources, on older (pre-4K) DeckLink card models you have to capture in 10
bit mode.


=item B<channels>

Defines number of audio channels to capture. Must be B<2>, B<8> or B<16>.
Defaults to B<2>.


=item B<duplex_mode>

Sets the decklink device duplex mode. Must be B<unset>, B<half> or B<full>.
Defaults to B<unset>.


=item B<timecode_format>

Timecode type to include in the frame and video stream metadata. Must be
B<none>, B<rp188vitc>, B<rp188vitc2>, B<rp188ltc>,
B<rp188hfr>, B<rp188any>, B<vitc>, B<vitc2>, or B<serial>.
Defaults to B<none> (not included).

In order to properly support 50/60 fps timecodes, the ordering of the queried
timecode types for B<rp188any> is HFR, VITC1, VITC2 and LTC for E<gt>30 fps
content. Note that this is slightly different to the ordering used by the
DeckLink API, which is HFR, VITC1, LTC, VITC2.


=item B<video_input>

Sets the video input source. Must be B<unset>, B<sdi>, B<hdmi>,
B<optical_sdi>, B<component>, B<composite> or B<s_video>.
Defaults to B<unset>.


=item B<audio_input>

Sets the audio input source. Must be B<unset>, B<embedded>,
B<aes_ebu>, B<analog>, B<analog_xlr>, B<analog_rca> or
B<microphone>. Defaults to B<unset>.


=item B<video_pts>

Sets the video packet timestamp source. Must be B<video>, B<audio>,
B<reference>, B<wallclock> or B<abs_wallclock>.
Defaults to B<video>.


=item B<audio_pts>

Sets the audio packet timestamp source. Must be B<video>, B<audio>,
B<reference>, B<wallclock> or B<abs_wallclock>.
Defaults to B<audio>.


=item B<draw_bars>

If set to B<true>, color bars are drawn in the event of a signal loss.
Defaults to B<true>.


=item B<queue_size>

Sets maximum input buffer size in bytes. If the buffering reaches this value,
incoming frames will be dropped.
Defaults to B<1073741824>.


=item B<audio_depth>

Sets the audio sample bit depth. Must be B<16> or B<32>.
Defaults to B<16>.


=item B<decklink_copyts>

If set to B<true>, timestamps are forwarded as they are without removing
the initial offset.
Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<timestamp_align>

Capture start time alignment in seconds. If set to nonzero, input frames are
dropped till the system timestamp aligns with configured value.
Alignment difference of up to one frame duration is tolerated.
This is useful for maintaining input synchronization across N different
hardware devices deployed for 'N-way' redundancy. The system time of different
hardware devices should be synchronized with protocols such as NTP or PTP,
before using this option.
Note that this method is not foolproof. In some border cases input
synchronization may not happen due to thread scheduling jitters in the OS.
Either sync could go wrong by 1 frame or in a rarer case
B<timestamp_align> seconds.
Defaults to B<0>.


=item B<wait_for_tc (>I<bool>B<)>

Drop frames till a frame with timecode is received. Sometimes serial timecode
isn't received with the first input frame. If that happens, the stored stream
timecode will be inaccurate. If this option is set to B<true>, input frames
are dropped till a frame with timecode is received.
Option I<timecode_format> must be specified.
Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<enable_klv(>I<bool>B<)>

If set to B<true>, extracts KLV data from VANC and outputs KLV packets.
KLV VANC packets are joined based on MID and PSC fields and aggregated into
one KLV packet.
Defaults to B<false>.

=head2 gdigrab


Win32 GDI-based screen capture device.

This device allows you to capture a region of the display on Windows.

There are two options for the input filename:
	
	desktop

or
	
	title=<window_title>


The first option will capture the entire desktop, or a fixed region of the
desktop. The second option will instead capture the contents of a single
window, regardless of its position on the screen.

For example, to grab the entire desktop using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i desktop out.mpg


Grab a 640x480 region at position C<10,20>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -video_size vga -i desktop out.mpg


Grab the contents of the window named "Calculator"
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i title=Calculator out.mpg

=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

Note that I<show_region> is incompatible with grabbing the contents
of a single window.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -show_region 1 -framerate 6 -video_size cif -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -i desktop out.mpg



=item B<video_size>

Set the video frame size. The default is to capture the full screen if F<desktop> is selected, or the full window size if F<title=I<window_title>> is selected.


=item B<offset_x>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the left edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned to the left of your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_x> value to move the region to that monitor.


=item B<offset_y>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the top edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned above your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_y> value to move the region to that monitor.

=head2 iec61883


FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and
libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the configure option
C<--enable-libiec61883> to compile with the device enabled.

The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video device
connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883 and the new Linux
FireWire stack (juju). This is the default DV/HDV input method in Linux

=item B<dvtype>

Override autodetection of DV/HDV. This should only be used if auto

The values B<auto>, B<dv> and B<hdv> are supported.


=item B<dvbuffer>

Set maximum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV, this
is an exact value. For HDV, it is not frame exact, since HDV does
not have a fixed frame size.


=item B<dvguid>

Select the capture device by specifying its GUID. Capturing will only

=head2 jack


JACK input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack
installed on your system.

A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for
each audio channel, with name I<client_name>:input_I<N>, where
I<client_name> is the name provided by the application, and I<N>
is a number which identifies the channel.
Each writable client will send the acquired data to the FFmpeg input
device.

Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the B<jack_connect>
and B<jack_disconnect> programs, or do it through a graphical interface,
for example with B<qjackctl>.

To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command
B<jack_lsp>.

Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client
with B<ffmpeg>.
	
	# Create a JACK writable client with name "ffmpeg".
	$ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav
	
	# Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
	$ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000
	
	# List the current JACK clients.
	$ jack_lsp -c
	system:capture_1
	system:capture_2
	system:playback_1
	system:playback_2
	ffmpeg:input_1

=item B<device>

DRM device to capture on.  Defaults to B</dev/dri/card0>.


=item B<format>

Pixel format of the framebuffer.  This can be autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7
or later, but needs to be provided for earlier versions.  Defaults to B<bgr0>,
which is the most common format used by the Linux console and Xorg X server.


=item B<format_modifier>

Format modifier to signal on output frames.  This is necessary to import correctly into
some APIs.  It can be autodetected if you are running Linux 5.7 or later, but will need
to be provided explicitly when needed in earlier versions.  See the libdrm documentation
for possible values.


=item B<crtc_id>

KMS CRTC ID to define the capture source.  The first active plane on the given CRTC
will be used.


=item B<plane_id>

KMS plane ID to define the capture source.  Defaults to the first active plane found if
neither B<crtc_id> nor B<plane_id> are specified.


=item B<framerate>

Framerate to capture at.  This is not synchronised to any page flipping or framebuffer
changes - it just defines the interval at which the framebuffer is sampled.  Sampling
faster than the framebuffer update rate will generate independent frames with the same
content.  Defaults to C<30>.


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4



=item *

Capture from the first active plane, download the result to normal frames and encode.
This will only work if the framebuffer is both linear and mappable - if not, the result
may be scrambled or fail to download.
	
	ffmpeg -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwdownload,format=bgr0' output.mp4



=item *

Capture from CRTC ID 42 at 60fps, map the result to VAAPI, convert to NV12 and encode as H.264.

=item *

To capture only part of a plane the output can be cropped - this can be used to capture
a single window, as long as it has a known absolute position and size.  For example, to
capture and encode the middle quarter of a 1920x1080 plane:
	
	ffmpeg -f kmsgrab -i - -vf 'hwmap=derive_device=vaapi,crop=960:540:480:270,scale_vaapi=960:540:nv12' -c:v h264_vaapi output.mp4

=head2 lavfi


Libavfilter input virtual device.

This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter
filtergraph.

For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a
corresponding stream which is mapped to the generated output. Currently
only video data is supported. The filtergraph is specified through the
option B<graph>.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<graph>

Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must be
labelled by a unique string of the form "outI<N>", where I<N> is a
number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
generated by the device.
The first unlabelled output is automatically assigned to the "out0"
label, but all the others need to be specified explicitly.

The suffix "+subcc" can be appended to the output label to create an extra
stream with the closed captions packets attached to that output
(experimental; only for EIA-608 / CEA-708 for now).
The subcc streams are created after all the normal streams, in the order of
the corresponding stream.
For example, if there is "out19+subcc", "out7+subcc" and up to "out42", the
stream #43 is subcc for stream #7 and stream #44 is subcc for stream #19.

If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input
device.


=item B<graph_file>

Set the filename of the filtergraph to be read and sent to the other
filters. Syntax of the filtergraph is the same as the one specified by
the option I<graph>.

=head2 openal


The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all systems with a
working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

To enable this input device during configuration, you need OpenAL
headers and libraries installed on your system, and need to configure
FFmpeg with C<--enable-openal>.

OpenAL headers and libraries should be provided as part of your OpenAL
implementation, or as an additional download (an SDK). Depending on your
installation you may need to specify additional flags via the
C<--extra-cflags> and C<--extra-ldflags> for allowing the build
system to locate the OpenAL headers and libraries.

An incomplete list of OpenAL implementations follows:


=over 4

=head2 video4linux2, v4l2


Video4Linux2 input video device.

"v4l2" can be used as alias for "video4linux2".

If FFmpeg is built with v4l-utils support (by using the
C<--enable-libv4l2> configure option), it is possible to use it with the
C<-use_libv4l2> input device option.

The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device
(e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the
kind F</dev/videoI<N>>, where I<N> is a number associated to
the device.

Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of
I<width>xI<height> sizes and frame rates. You can check which are
supported using B<-list_formats all> for Video4Linux2 devices.
Some devices, like TV cards, support one or more standards. It is possible
to list all the supported standards using B<-list_standards all>.

The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel
version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the real time
clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at
boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The
B<-timestamps abs> or B<-ts abs> option can be used to force
conversion into the real time clock.

Some usage examples of the video4linux2 device with B<ffmpeg>
and B<ffplay>:

=head2 x11grab


X11 video input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libxcb
installed on your system. It will be automatically detected during
configuration.

This device allows one to capture a region of an X11 display.

The filename passed as input has the syntax:
	
	[<hostname>]:<display_number>.<screen_number>[+<x_offset>,<y_offset>]


I<hostname>:I<display_number>.I<screen_number> specifies the
X11 display name of the screen to grab from. I<hostname> can be
omitted, and defaults to "localhost". The environment variable
B<DISPLAY> contains the default display name.

I<x_offset> and I<y_offset> specify the offsets of the grabbed
area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They
default to 0.

Check the X11 documentation (e.g. B<man X>) for more detailed
information.

Use the B<xdpyinfo> program for getting basic information about
the properties of your X11 display (e.g. grep for "name" or
"dimensions").

For example to grab from F<:0.0> using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


Grab at position C<10,20>:

=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<select_region>

Specify whether to select the grabbing area graphically using the pointer.
A value of C<1> prompts the user to select the grabbing area graphically
by clicking and dragging. A single click with no dragging will select the
whole screen. A region with zero width or height will also select the whole
screen. This option overwrites the I<video_size>, I<grab_x>, and
I<grab_y> options. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<draw_mouse>

Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of C<0> specifies
not to draw the pointer. Default value is C<1>.


=item B<follow_mouse>

Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be
C<centered> or a number of pixels I<PIXELS>.

When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing region follows the mouse
pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region; otherwise, the region
follows only when the mouse pointer reaches within I<PIXELS> (greater than
zero) to the edge of region.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to edge:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg



=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.


=item B<region_border>

Set the region border thickness if B<-show_region 1> is used.
Range is 1 to 128 and default is 3 (XCB-based x11grab only).

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg


With I<follow_mouse>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg



=item B<window_id>

Grab this window, instead of the whole screen. Default value is 0, which maps to
the whole screen (root window).

The id of a window can be found using the B<xwininfo> program, possibly with options -tree and
-root.

If the window is later enlarged, the new area is not recorded. Video ends when
the window is closed, unmapped (i.e., iconified) or shrunk beyond the video
size (which defaults to the initial window size).

This option disables options B<follow_mouse> and B<select_region>.


=item B<video_size>

Set the video frame size. Default is the full desktop or window.


=item B<grab_x>


=item B<grab_y>

Set the grabbing region coordinates. They are expressed as offset from
the top left corner of the X11 window and correspond to the
I<x_offset> and I<y_offset> parameters in the device name. The
default value for both options is 0.

applicable in this case.

=item B<soxr>

select the SoX Resampler (where available); compensation, and filter options
filter_size, phase_shift, exact_rational, filter_type & kaiser_beta, are not
applicable in this case.

=back



=item B<filter_size>

For swr only, set resampling filter size, default value is 32.


=item B<phase_shift>

For swr only, set resampling phase shift, default value is 10, and must be in
the interval [0,30].


=item B<linear_interp>

Use linear interpolation when enabled (the default). Disable it if you want
to preserve speed instead of quality when exact_rational fails.


=item B<exact_rational>

For swr only, when enabled, try to use exact phase_count based on input and
output sample rate. However, if it is larger than C<1 E<lt>E<lt> phase_shift>,
the phase_count will be C<1 E<lt>E<lt> phase_shift> as fallback. Default is enabled.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency (swr: 6dB point; soxr: 0dB point) ratio; must be a float
value between 0 and 1.  Default value is 0.97 with swr, and 0.91 with soxr
(which, with a sample-rate of 44100, preserves the entire audio band to 20kHz).


=item B<precision>

For soxr only, the precision in bits to which the resampled signal will be
calculated.  The default value of 20 (which, with suitable dithering, is
appropriate for a destination bit-depth of 16) gives SoX's 'High Quality'; a
value of 28 gives SoX's 'Very High Quality'.


=item B<cheby>

For soxr only, selects passband rolloff none (Chebyshev) & higher-precision
approximation for 'irrational' ratios. Default value is 0.


=item B<async>

For swr only, simple 1 parameter audio sync to timestamps using stretching,
squeezing, filling and trimming. Setting this to 1 will enable filling and
trimming, larger values represent the maximum amount in samples that the data
may be stretched or squeezed for each second.
Default value is 0, thus no compensation is applied to make the samples match
the audio timestamps.


=item B<first_pts>

For swr only, assume the first pts should be this value. The time unit is 1 / sample rate.
This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
assumption is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative pts due to encoder delay.


=item B<min_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger stretching/squeezing/filling or trimming of the
data to make it match the timestamps. The default is that
stretching/squeezing/filling and trimming is disabled
(B<min_comp> = C<FLT_MAX>).


=item B<min_hard_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger adding/dropping samples to make it match the
timestamps.  This option effectively is a threshold to select between
hard (trim/fill) and soft (squeeze/stretch) compensation. Note that
all compensation is by default disabled through B<min_comp>.
The default is 0.1.


=item B<comp_duration>

For swr only, set duration (in seconds) over which data is stretched/squeezed
to make it match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value,
default value is 1.0.


=item B<max_soft_comp>

For swr only, set maximum factor by which data is stretched/squeezed to make it
match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value, default value
is 0.

=item B<kaiser_beta>

For swr only, set Kaiser window beta value. Must be a double float value in the
interval [2,16], default value is 9.


=item B<output_sample_bits>

For swr only, set number of used output sample bits for dithering. Must be an integer in the
interval [0,64], default value is 0, which means it's not used.

=head1 FILTERING INTRODUCTION


Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the
following filtergraph.

	
	                [main]
	input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
	            |                             ^
	            |[tmp]                  [flip]|
	            +-----> crop --> vflip -------+


This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one
stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it
back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the
following command to achieve this:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT


The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half of the output video.

Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct
linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example,
I<crop,vflip> are in one linear chain, I<split> and
I<overlay> are separately in another. The points where the linear
chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the
example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to
the labels I<[main]> and I<[tmp]>.

The stream sent to the second output of I<split>, labelled as
I<[tmp]>, is processed through the I<crop> filter, which crops
away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The
I<overlay> filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the
split filter (which was labelled as I<[main]>), and overlay on its
lower half the output generated by the I<crop,vflip> filterchain.

Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.

There exist so-called I<source filters> that do not have an
audio/video input, and I<sink filters> that will not have audio/video
output.



=head1 GRAPH


The F<graph2dot> program included in the FFmpeg F<tools>
directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and issue a
corresponding textual representation in the dot language.

Invoke the command:
	
	graph2dot -h


to see how to use F<graph2dot>.

You can then pass the dot description to the F<dot> program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filtergraph.

For example the sequence of commands:
	
	echo <GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> | \
	tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \
	dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \
	display graph.png


can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the I<GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:
	
	ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

your I<GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> string will need to be of the form:
	
	nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

you may also need to set the I<nullsrc> parameters and add a I<format>
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.



=head1 FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION


A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.

Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.

A filter with no input pads is called a "source", and a filter with no
output pads is called a "sink".



=head2 Filtergraph syntax


A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is recognized by the
B<-filter>/B<-vf>/B<-af> and
B<-filter_complex> options in B<ffmpeg> and
B<-vf>/B<-af> in B<ffplay>, and by the
C<avfilter_graph_parse_ptr()> function defined in
F<libavfilter/avfilter.h>.

A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of ","-separated filter descriptions.

A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of ";"-separated filterchain
descriptions.

A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[I<in_link_1>]...[I<in_link_N>]I<filter_name>@I<id>=I<arguments>[I<out_link_1>]...[I<out_link_M>]

I<filter_name> is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program optionally followed by "@I<id>".
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=I<arguments>".

I<arguments> is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:

=over 4



=item *

A ':'-separated list of I<key=value> pairs.


=item *

A ':'-separated list of I<value>. In this case, the keys are assumed to be
the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the C<fade> filter
declares three options in this order -- B<type>, B<start_frame> and
B<nb_frames>. Then the parameter list I<in:0:30> means that the value
I<in> is assigned to the option B<type>, I<0> to
B<start_frame> and I<30> to B<nb_frames>.


=item *

A ':'-separated list of mixed direct I<value> and long I<key=value>
pairs. The direct I<value> must precede the I<key=value> pairs, and
follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following
I<key=value> pairs can be set in any preferred order.


=back


If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the C<format> filter
takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by
B<|>.

The list of arguments can be quoted using the character B<'> as initial
and ending mark, and the character B<\> for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
B<[]=;,>) is encountered.

The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels I<in_link_1>
... I<in_link_N>, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels I<out_link_1> ... I<out_link_M>, are
associated to the output pads.

When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.

If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain
	
	nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
"L1", the first input pad of overlay is labelled "L2", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.

In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not
specified, "in" is assumed; if the output label of the last filter is not
specified, "out" is assumed.

In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.

Libavfilter will automatically insert B<scale> filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
C<sws_flags=I<flags>;>
to the filtergraph description.

Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:
	
	<NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
	<FILTER_NAME>      ::= <NAME>["@"<NAME>]
	<LINKLABEL>        ::= "[" <NAME> "]"
	<LINKLABELS>       ::= <LINKLABEL> [<LINKLABELS>]
	<FILTER_ARGUMENTS> ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
	<FILTER>           ::= [<LINKLABELS>] <FILTER_NAME> ["=" <FILTER_ARGUMENTS>] [<LINKLABELS>]
	<FILTERCHAIN>      ::= <FILTER> [,<FILTERCHAIN>]
	<FILTERGRAPH>      ::= [sws_flags=<flags>;] <FILTERCHAIN> [;<FILTERGRAPH>]




=head2 Notes on filtergraph escaping


Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of
escaping. See B<the "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual> for more
information about the employed escaping procedure.

A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option
value, which may contain the special character C<:> used to
separate values, or one of the escaping characters C<\'>.

A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which
may contain the escaping characters C<\'> or the special
characters C<[],;> used by the filtergraph description.

Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you
need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special
characters contained within it.

For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
the B<drawtext> filter description B<text> value:
	
	this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters


This string contains the C<'> special escaping character, and the
C<:> special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:
	
	text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one, or more, special characters


A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:
	
	drawtext=text=this is a \\\'string\\\'\\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters

(note that in addition to the C<\'> escaping special characters,
also C<,> needs to be escaped).

Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
C<\> is special and needs to be escaped with another C<\>, the
previous string will finally result in:
	
	-vf "drawtext=text=this is a \\\\\\'string\\\\\\'\\\\: may contain one\\, or more\\, special characters"



=head1 TIMELINE EDITING


Some filters support a generic B<enable> option. For the filters
supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is
evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non-zero,
the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the
next filter in the filtergraph.

The expression accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<t>

timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown


=item B<n>

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0


=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown


=item B<w>


=item B<h>

width and height of the input frame if video

=back


Additionally, these filters support an B<enable> command that can be used
to re-define the expression.

Like any other filtering option, the B<enable> option follows the same
rules.

For example, to enable a blur filter (B<smartblur>) from 10 seconds to 3
minutes, and a B<curves> filter starting at 3 seconds:
	
	smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
	curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process


See C<ffmpeg -filters> to view which filters have timeline support.




=head1 CHANGING OPTIONS AT RUNTIME WITH A COMMAND


Some options can be changed during the operation of the filter using
a command. These options are marked 'T' on the output of
B<ffmpeg> B<-h filter=E<lt>name of filterE<gt>>.
The name of the command is the name of the option and the argument is
the new value.



=head1 OPTIONS FOR FILTERS WITH SEVERAL INPUTS 


Some filters with several inputs support a common set of options.
These options can only be set by name, not with the short notation.


=over 4


=item B<eof_action>

The action to take when EOF is encountered on the secondary input; it accepts
one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<repeat>

Repeat the last frame (the default).

=item B<endall>

End both streams.

=item B<pass>

Pass the main input through.

=back



=item B<shortest>

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.


=item B<repeatlast>

If set to 1, force the filter to extend the last frame of secondary streams
until the end of the primary stream. A value of 0 disables this behavior.
Default value is 1.

=back




=head1 AUDIO FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using C<--disable-filters>.
The configure output will show the audio filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.


=head2 acompressor


A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.
Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to
improve the overall loudness. It's done to get the highest attention
of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track.
If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead"
afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect
but can also destroy a track completely).
The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is
the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings
it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.

Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level
C<threshold> and dividing it by the factor set with C<ratio>.
So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio
of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of
the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release".
C<attack> determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold
before any reduction will occur and C<release> sets the time the signal
has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the
C<makeup> setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and
raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the
source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the C<knee> flattens the
hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.


=item B<mode>

Set mode of compressor operation. Can be C<upward> or C<downward>.
Default is C<downward>.


=item B<threshold>

If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain
reduction.
By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.


=item B<ratio>

Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level
rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.
Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.


=item B<attack>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.


=item B<release>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before
reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.


=item B<makeup>

Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing.
Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.


=item B<knee>

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.


=item B<link>

Choose if the C<average> level between all channels of input stream
or the louder(C<maximum>) channel of input stream affects the
reduction. Default is C<average>.


=item B<detection>

Should the exact signal be taken in case of C<peak> or an RMS one in case
of C<rms>. Default is C<rms> which is mostly smoother.


=item B<mix>

How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1.
Range is between 0 and 1.

The cross fade is applied for specified duration near the end of first stream.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<nb_samples, ns>

Specify the number of samples for which the cross fade effect has to last.
At the end of the cross fade effect the first input audio will be completely
silent. Default is 44100.


=item B<duration, d>

Specify the duration of the cross fade effect. See
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>
for the accepted syntax.
By default the duration is determined by I<nb_samples>.
If set this option is used instead of I<nb_samples>.


=item B<overlap, o>

Should first stream end overlap with second stream start. Default is enabled.


=item B<curve1>

Set curve for cross fade transition for first stream.


=item B<curve2>

Set curve for cross fade transition for second stream.

For description of available curve types see B<afade> filter description.

=back



=head2 acrusher


Reduce audio bit resolution.

This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher
is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled
with. This doesn't change the bit depth at all, it just produces the
effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital".
This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete
bit depths.
Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of
the lower and the upper half of the signal.
An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce "softer" crushing sounds.

Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.
This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones.
The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesn't gate low
signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception,
so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant.
Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set level in.


=item B<level_out>

Set level out.


=item B<bits>

Set bit reduction.


=item B<mix>

=item B<aa>

Set anti-aliasing.


=item B<samples>

Set sample reduction.


=item B<lfo>

Enable LFO. By default disabled.


=item B<lforange>

Set LFO range.


=item B<lforate>

Set LFO rate.

=item B<window, w>

Set window size, in milliseconds. Allowed range is from C<10> to
C<100>. Default value is C<55> milliseconds.
This sets size of window which will be processed at once.


=item B<overlap, o>

Set window overlap, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from

Default value is C<2>.
This controls the strength of impulsive noise which is going to be removed.
The lower value, the more samples will be detected as impulsive noise.


=item B<burst, b>

Set burst fusion, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is C<0> to
C<10>. Default value is C<2>.
If any two samples detected as noise are spaced less than this value then any
sample between those two samples will be also detected as noise.


=item B<method, m>

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<add, a>

=item B<delays>

Set list of delays in milliseconds for each channel separated by '|'.
Unused delays will be silently ignored. If number of given delays is
smaller than number of channels all remaining channels will not be delayed.
If you want to delay exact number of samples, append 'S' to number.
If you want instead to delay in seconds, append 's' to number.


=item B<all>

Apply echoing to the input audio.

Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst mountains
(and sometimes large buildings) when talking or shouting; digital echo
effects emulate this behaviour and are often used to help fill out the
sound of a single instrument or vocal. The time difference between the
original signal and the reflection is the C<delay>, and the
loudness of the reflected signal is the C<decay>.
Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.

A description of the accepted parameters follows.


=over 4


=item B<in_gain>

Set input gain of reflected signal. Default is C<0.6>.


=item B<out_gain>

Set output gain of reflected signal. Default is C<0.3>.


=item B<delays>

Set list of time intervals in milliseconds between original signal and reflections
separated by '|'. Allowed range for each C<delay> is C<(0 - 90000.0]>.
Default is C<1000>.


=item B<decays>

Set list of loudness of reflected signals separated by '|'.
Allowed range for each C<decay> is C<(0 - 1.0]>.
Default is C<0.5>.

=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Make it sound as if there are twice as many instruments as are actually playing:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.88:60:0.4



=item *

If delay is very short, then it sounds like a (metallic) robot playing music:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.88:6:0.4



=item *

A longer delay will sound like an open air concert in the mountains:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.9:1000:0.3



=item *

Same as above but with one more mountain:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.9:1000|1800:0.3|0.25


=back



=head2 aemphasis

Audio emphasis filter creates or restores material directly taken from LPs or
emphased CDs with different filter curves. E.g. to store music on vinyl the
signal has to be altered by a filter first to even out the disadvantages of
this recording medium.
Once the material is played back the inverse filter has to be applied to
restore the distortion of the frequency response.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set input gain.


=item B<level_out>

=head2 agate


A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal
processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.

Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level I<threshold>
and dividing it by the factor set with I<ratio>. The bottom of the noise
floor is set via I<range>. Because an exact manipulation of the signal
would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over
time. This is done by setting I<attack> and I<release>.

I<attack> determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold
before any reduction will occur and I<release> sets the time the signal
has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.


=over 4

Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.


=item B<mode>

Set the mode of operation. Can be C<upward> or C<downward>.
Default is C<downward>. If set to C<upward> mode, higher parts of signal
will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
Otherwise, in case of C<downward> lower parts of signal will be reduced.


=item B<range>

Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.
Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.


=item B<threshold>

If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.
Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.


=item B<ratio>

Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced.
Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.


=item B<attack>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction stops.
Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<release>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the
reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<makeup>

Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.


=item B<detection>

Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.
Default is C<rms>. Can be C<peak> or C<rms>.


=item B<link>

the reduction.
Default is C<average>. Can be C<average> or C<maximum>.

=over 4


=item B<loop>

Set the number of loops. Setting this value to -1 will result in infinite loops.
Default is 0.

=head2 amerge


Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<inputs>

Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.


=back


If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.

For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input
is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).

On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the
shortest.


=head3 Examples

Note that this filter only supports float samples (the I<amerge>
and I<pan> audio filters support many formats). If the I<amix>
input has integer samples then B<aresample> will be automatically
inserted to perform the conversion to float samples.

For example
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT

=head2 apulsator


Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo.
But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume
of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with
different waveforms and shifted phases.
This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right
channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other.
The left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional tremolo.
An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted
in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as
an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the
phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some "bypassing" sounds with
sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from
the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the all above options as B<commands>.


=head2 atempo


Adjust audio tempo.

The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not
specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must
be in the [0.5, 100.0] range.

Note that tempo greater than 2 will skip some samples rather than
blend them in.  If for any reason this is a concern it is always
possible to daisy-chain several instances of atempo to achieve the
desired product tempo.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Slow down audio to 80% tempo:
	
	atempo=0.8



=item *

To speed up audio to 300% tempo:
	
	atempo=3



=item *

To speed up audio to 300% tempo by daisy-chaining two atempo instances:
	
	atempo=sqrt(3),atempo=sqrt(3)


=back



=head3 Commands

=over 4


=item B<tempo>

Change filter tempo scale factor.
Syntax for the command is : "I<tempo>"

=back



=head2 atrim


Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio
sample with the timestamp I<start> will be the first sample in the output.


=item B<end>

Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the
audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp I<end> will be
the last sample in the output.


=item B<start_pts>

Same as I<start>, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples
instead of seconds.


=item B<end_pts>

Same as I<end>, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead
of seconds.


=item B<duration>

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.


=item B<start_sample>

The number of the first sample that should be output.


=item B<end_sample>

The number of the first sample that should be dropped.

=back


B<start>, B<end>, and B<duration> are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the B<duration>
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the
samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will
give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at
zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish
to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the
atrim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

=over 4


=item *

Drop everything except the second minute of input:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120



=item *

Keep only the first 1000 samples:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=end_sample=1000



=back



=head2 axcorrelate

Calculate normalized cross-correlation between two input audio streams.

Resulted samples are always between -1 and 1 inclusive.
If result is 1 it means two input samples are highly correlated in that selected segment.
Result 0 means they are not correlated at all.
If result is -1 it means two input samples are out of phase, which means they cancel each
other.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<size>

Set size of segment over which cross-correlation is calculated.
Default is 256. Allowed range is from 2 to 131072.


=item B<algo>

Set algorithm for cross-correlation. Can be C<slow> or C<fast>.
Default is C<slow>. Fast algorithm assumes mean values over any given segment
are always zero and thus need much less calculations to make.
This is generally not true, but is valid for typical audio streams.

=back

=back



=head2 chorus

Add a chorus effect to the audio.

Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.

Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay is
constant, with chorus, it is varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation.
The modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is played before or after
the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed
sound tuned around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are slightly
off key.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<in_gain>

Set input gain. Default is 0.4.


=item B<out_gain>

Set output gain. Default is 0.4.


=item B<delays>

=head2 compand

Compress or expand the audio's dynamic range.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<attacks>


=item B<decays>

A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. I<attacks> refers to
increase of volume and I<decays> refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.
If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last
set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.


=item B<points>

A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the
maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using
the following syntax: C<x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....> or
C<x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....>

The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function
does not have to be monotonically rising. The point C<0/0> is assumed but
may be overridden (by C<0/out-dBn>). Typical values for the transfer
function are C<-70/-70|-60/-20|1/0>.


=item B<soft-knee>

Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.


=item B<gain>

Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer
function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain.
It defaults to 0.


=item B<volume>

Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering
starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for
example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the
companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially
quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.


=item B<delay>

Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is
delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay
approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively
operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

=head2 compensationdelay


Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing
positions of microphones or speakers.

For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in
different locations. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in
normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on
their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when
these microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of
~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone capture the signal in
antiphase to the other microphone. That makes the final mix sound moody.
This filter helps to solve phasing problems by adding different delays
to each microphone track and make them synchronized.

The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and
synchronize other tracks one by one with it.
Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too.
Higher sample rates will give more tolerance.

The filter accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<mm>

=head2 dcshift

Apply a DC shift to the audio.

This can be useful to remove a DC offset (caused perhaps by a hardware problem
in the recording chain) from the audio. The effect of a DC offset is reduced
headroom and hence volume. The B<astats> filter can be used to determine if
a signal has a DC offset.

=over 4


=item B<length>

Default is 3 seconds.

=back



=head2 dynaudnorm

Dynamic Audio Normalizer.

This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order
to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in
contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio.
This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the audio
while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" sections. In other words:
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud
sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the
same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves
this goal *without* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100%
of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file.


=over 4


=item B<framelen, f>

Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds.
Default is 500 milliseconds.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks,
referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no
meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the
peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a "standard"
normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each
frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has
been found to give good results with most files.
Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined
automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file.


=item B<gausssize, g>

Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd
number. Default is 31.
Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the
C<window size> of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter's window size
is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of
simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31
takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and
the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger
smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain
adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing
effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation.
In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a "traditional" normalization filter. On the
contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.


=item B<peak, p>

Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude
level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the
target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also
makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude.
A frame's maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak
magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*.
It is not recommended to go above this value.


=item B<maxgain, m>

Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain
factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not
result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by
the frame's highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
additionally bounds the frame's maximum gain factor by a predetermined
(global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain
factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain
factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and
it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input
with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even
higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does
not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold).
Instead, a "sigmoid" threshold function will be applied. This way, the
gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that
value.


=item B<targetrms, r>

Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization.
This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined
(only) by the frame's highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can
be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal
level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer can also take into account the frame's root mean square,
abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to
determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered
that the RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness" than
just looking at the signal's peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all
frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be
established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame's local gain
factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value.
Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the
frame's highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.


=item B<coupling, n>

Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same
amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e.
the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel.
However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different
channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s).
In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way,
the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending
only on the individual channel's highest magnitude sample. This allows for
harmonizing the volume of the different channels.


=item B<correctdc, c>

Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled.
An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values.
In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the
-1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the
audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around the zero point.
That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a
single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that
value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from
0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a
DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic
Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction.
With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine
the mean value, or "DC correction" offset, of each input frame and subtract
that value from all of the frame's sample values which ensures those samples
are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame
boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly
between neighbouring frames.


=item B<altboundary, b>

Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood
around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as the
subsequent frames. However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very
beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all neighbouring
frames are available. In particular, for the first few frames in the audio
file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few
frames in the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the
question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames
in the "boundary" region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes
to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor
of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and
"fade out" at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.


=item B<compress, s>

Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional"
compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the
full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However,
in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer's
normalization algorithm with a more "traditional" compression.
For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression
(thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled,
all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior
to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is
going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value.
However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold
value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual
frame.
In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa.
Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear.


=item B<threshold, t>

Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible
magnitude level for the audio input which will be normalized.
If input frame volume is above this value frame will be normalized.
Otherwise frame may not be normalized at all. The default value is set
to 0, which means all input frames will be normalized.
This option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to be amplified.

=head2 join


Join multiple input streams into one multi-channel stream.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<inputs>

The number of input streams. It defaults to 2.


=item B<channel_layout>

The desired output channel layout. It defaults to stereo.


=item B<map>

Map channels from inputs to output. The argument is a '|'-separated list of
mappings, each in the C<I<input_idx>.I<in_channel>-I<out_channel>>
form. I<input_idx> is the 0-based index of the input stream. I<in_channel>
can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its
index in the specified input stream. I<out_channel> is the name of the output
channel.

=back


The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when they are not specified
explicitly. It does so by first trying to find an unused matching input channel
and if that fails it picks the first unused input channel.

Join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts):
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex join=inputs=3 OUTPUT


Build a 5.1 output from 6 single-channel streams:
	
	ffmpeg -i fl -i fr -i fc -i sl -i sr -i lfe -filter_complex
	'join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=0.0-FL|1.0-FR|2.0-FC|3.0-SL|4.0-SR|5.0-LFE'

variable B<LADSPA_PATH> is defined, the LADSPA plugin is searched in
each one of the directories specified by the colon separated list in
B<LADSPA_PATH>, otherwise in the standard LADSPA paths, which are in
this order: F<HOME/.ladspa/lib/>, F</usr/local/lib/ladspa/>,
F</usr/lib/ladspa/>.


=item B<plugin, p>

Specifies the plugin within the library. Some libraries contain only
one plugin, but others contain many of them. If this is not set filter
will list all available plugins within the specified library.


=item B<controls, c>

Alternatively they can be also defined using the following syntax:
I<value0>|I<value1>|I<value2>|..., where
I<valuei> is the value set on the I<i>-th control.
If B<controls> is set to C<help>, all available controls and
their valid ranges are printed.

C<measured_I>, C<measured_LRA>, C<measured_TP>,
and C<measured_thresh> must all be specified. Target LRA shouldn't
be lower than source LRA and the change in integrated loudness shouldn't
result in a true peak which exceeds the target TP. If any of these
conditions aren't met, normalization mode will revert to I<dynamic>.
Options are C<true> or C<false>. Default is C<true>.


=item B<dual_mono>

Treat mono input files as "dual-mono". If a mono file is intended for playback
on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect.
If set to C<true>, this option will compensate for this effect.

=head2 mcompand

Multiband Compress or expand the audio's dynamic range.

The input audio is divided into bands using 4th order Linkwitz-Riley IIRs.

=head2 pan


Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output
channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

This filter is also designed to efficiently remap the channels of an audio
stream.

The filter accepts parameters of the form:
"I<l>|I<outdef>|I<outdef>|..."


=over 4


=item B<l>

output channel layout or number of channels


=item B<outdef>

output channel specification, of the form:
"I<out_name>=[I<gain>*]I<in_name>[(+-)[I<gain>*]I<in_name>...]"


=item B<out_name>

output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a channel
number (c0, c1, etc.)


=item B<gain>

multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume unchanged


=item B<in_name>

input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not possible to mix
named and numbered input channels

=back


If the `=' in a channel specification is replaced by `E<lt>', then the gains for
that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus
avoiding clipping noise.


=head3 Mixing examples


For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a bigger
factor for the left channel:
	
	pan=1c|c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1


A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5- and
7-channels surround:
	
	pan=stereo| FL < FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL | FR < FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR


Note that B<ffmpeg> integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system
that should be preferred (see "-ac" option) unless you have very specific
needs.


=head3 Remapping examples


The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:


=over 4


=item *<gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,>


=item *<only one input per channel output,>


=back


If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user ("Pure
channel mapping detected"), and use an optimized and lossless method to do the
remapping.

For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
dropping the extra channels:
	
	pan="stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR"


Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels
and keep the input channel layout:
	
	pan="5.1| c0=c1 | c1=c0 | c2=c2 | c3=c3 | c4=c4 | c5=c5"


If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and
still keep the stereo channel layout) with:
	
	pan="stereo|c1=c1"


Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both
front left and right:
	
	pan="stereo| c0=FR | c1=FR"



=head2 replaygain


ReplayGain scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream as an input and
outputs it unchanged.
At end of filtering it displays C<track_gain> and C<track_peak>.


=head2 resample


Convert the audio sample format, sample rate and channel layout. It is
not meant to be used directly.

=head2 sidechaincompress


This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability to compress
detected signal using second input signal.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.
The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters in later stages of
processing. See B<pan> and B<amerge> filter.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.


=item B<mode>

Set mode of compressor operation. Can be C<upward> or C<downward>.
Default is C<downward>.


=item B<threshold>

If a signal of second stream raises above this level it will affect the gain
reduction of first stream.
By default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.


=item B<ratio>

Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level
raised 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.
Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.


=item B<attack>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain
reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.


=item B<release>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before
reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.

=head2 sidechaingate


A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to
filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage.
Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the
threshold.
For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal
the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs
appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a
natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted
guitar.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_in>

Set input level before filtering.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.


=item B<mode>

Set the mode of operation. Can be C<upward> or C<downward>.
Default is C<downward>. If set to C<upward> mode, higher parts of signal
will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction.
Otherwise, in case of C<downward> lower parts of signal will be reduced.


=item B<range>

Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.
Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.


=item B<threshold>

If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.
Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.


=item B<ratio>

Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced.
Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.


=item B<attack>

reduction stops.
Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<release>

Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the
reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds.
Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.


=item B<makeup>

Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.


=item B<knee>

Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.
Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.


=item B<detection>

Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.
Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.


=item B<link>

Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects
the reduction.
Default is average. Can be average or maximum.


=item B<level_sc>

Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625 to 64.

=head2 silencedetect


Detect silence in an audio stream.

This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less
or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the
minimum detected noise duration.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
C<lavfi.silence_start> or C<lavfi.silence_start.X> metadata key
is set on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection
duration and it contains the timestamp of the first frame of the silence.

The C<lavfi.silence_duration> or C<lavfi.silence_duration.X>
and C<lavfi.silence_end> or C<lavfi.silence_end.X> metadata
keys are set on the first frame after the silence. If B<mono> is
enabled, and each channel is evaluated separately, the C<.X>
suffixed keys are used, and C<X> corresponds to the channel number.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<noise, n>

Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the
specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.


=item B<duration, d>

Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds). See
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>

=head2 silenceremove


Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<start_periods>

This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of
the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the
beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio
the I<start_periods> will be C<1> but it can be increased to higher
values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<start_duration>

Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops
trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated
as silence and trimmed off. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<start_threshold>

This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital
audio, a value of C<0> may be fine but for audio recorded from analog,
you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<start_silence>

Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.


=item B<start_mode>

Specify mode of detection of silence end in start of multi-channel audio.
Can be I<any> or I<all>. Default is I<any>.
With I<any>, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.
With I<all>, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.


=item B<stop_periods>

Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio.
To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a I<stop_periods>
that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
I<start_periods>, making it suitable for removing periods of silence
in the middle of the audio.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<stop_duration>

Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any
more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in
the audio.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<stop_threshold>

This is the same as B<start_threshold> but for trimming silence from
the end of audio.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is C<0>.


=item B<stop_silence>

Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.


=item B<stop_mode>

Specify mode of detection of silence start in end of multi-channel audio.
Can be I<any> or I<all>. Default is I<any>.
With I<any>, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.
With I<all>, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause
stopped trimming of silence.


=item B<detection>

Set how is silence detected. Can be C<rms> or C<peak>. Second is faster
and works better with digital silence which is exactly 0.
Default value is C<rms>.


=item B<window>

Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number
of samples for detecting silence.
Default value is C<0.02>. Allowed range is from C<0> to C<10>.

=head2 speechnorm

Speech Normalizer.

This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio samples
(local set of samples all above or all below zero and between two nearest zero crossings) depending
on threshold value, so audio reaches target peak value under conditions controlled by below options.

The filter accepts the following options:

Set the maximum expansion factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0.
This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The maximum expansion
would be such that local peak value reaches target peak value but never to surpass it and that
ratio between new and previous peak value does not surpass this option value.


=item B<compression, c>

Set the maximum compression factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0.
This option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples compression. This option is used
only if B<threshold> option is set to value greater than 0.0, then in such cases
when local peak is lower or same as value set by B<threshold> all samples belonging to
that peak's half-cycle will be compressed by current compression factor.


=item B<threshold, t>

Set the threshold value. Default value is 0.0. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.
This option specifies which half-cycles of samples will be compressed and which will be expanded.
Any half-cycle samples with their local peak value below or same as this option value will be
compressed by current compression factor, otherwise, if greater than threshold value they will be
expanded with expansion factor so that it could reach peak target value but never surpass it.


=item B<raise, r>

Set the expansion raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.
Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast expansion factor is raised per
each new half-cycle until it reaches B<expansion> value.
Setting this options too high may lead to distortions.


=item B<fall, f>

Set the compression raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.
Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast compression factor is raised per
each new half-cycle until it reaches B<compression> value.


=item B<channels, h>

Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.


=item B<invert, i>

Enable inverted filtering, by default is disabled. This inverts interpretation of B<threshold>
option. When enabled any half-cycle of samples with their local peak value below or same as
B<threshold> option will be expanded otherwise it will be compressed.


=item B<link, l>

Link channels when calculating gain applied to each filtered channel sample, by default is disabled.
When disabled each filtered channel gain calculation is independent, otherwise when this option
is enabled the minimum of all possible gains for each filtered channel is used.

the volume will be printed in the log when the input stream end is reached.

In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of a histogram of the
registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of
the samples).

All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.


=head3 Examples


Here is an excerpt of the output:
	
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409


It means that:

=over 4


=item *

The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.

=item *

The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and -5 dB.

=item *

There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.

=back


In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping,
raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.



=head1 AUDIO SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available audio sources.

The timebase which will be used for timestamps of submitted frames. It must be
either a floating-point number or in I<numerator>/I<denominator> form.


=item B<sample_rate>

The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.


=item B<sample_fmt>

The sample format of the incoming audio buffers.
Either a sample format name or its corresponding integer representation from
the enum AVSampleFormat in F<libavutil/samplefmt.h>


=item B<channel_layout>

The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers.

F<libavutil/channel_layout.c> or its corresponding integer representation
from the AV_CH_LAYOUT_* macros in F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>


=item B<channels>

The number of channels of the incoming audio buffers.
If both I<channels> and I<channel_layout> are specified, then they
must be consistent.

=head3 Examples


	
	abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=s16p:channel_layout=stereo


will instruct the source to accept planar 16bit signed stereo at 44100Hz.
Since the sample format with name "s16p" corresponds to the number
6 and the "stereo" channel layout corresponds to the value 0x3, this is
equivalent to:

=head1 AUDIO SINKS


Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.

defines the incoming buffers' formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to C<avfilter_init_filter> for initialization.

=head2 anullsink

mainly useful as a template and for use in analysis / debugging
tools.



=head1 VIDEO FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using C<--disable-filters>.
The configure output will show the video filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available video filters.


=head2 addroi


Mark a region of interest in a video frame.

The frame data is passed through unchanged, but metadata is attached
to the frame indicating regions of interest which can affect the
behaviour of later encoding.  Multiple regions can be marked by
applying the filter multiple times.


=over 4


=item B<x>

Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the frame.

=item B<y>

Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.

=item B<w>

Region width in pixels.

=item B<h>

Region height in pixels.

The parameters I<x>, I<y>, I<w> and I<h> are expressions,
and may contain the following variables:

=over 4


=item B<iw>

Width of the input frame.

=item B<ih>

Height of the input frame.

=back



=item B<qoffset>

Quantisation offset to apply within the region.

This must be a real value in the range -1 to +1.  A value of zero
indicates no quality change.  A negative value asks for better quality
(less quantisation), while a positive value asks for worse quality
(greater quantisation).

The range is calibrated so that the extreme values indicate the
largest possible offset - if the rest of the frame is encoded with the
worst possible quality, an offset of -1 indicates that this region
should be encoded with the best possible quality anyway.  Intermediate
values are then interpolated in some codec-dependent way.

For example, in 10-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter varies between
-12 and 51.  A typical qoffset value of -1/10 therefore indicates that
this region should be encoded with a QP around one-tenth of the full
range better than the rest of the frame.  So, if most of the frame
were to be encoded with a QP of around 30, this region would get a QP
of around 24 (an offset of approximately -1/10 * (51 - -12) = -6.3).
An extreme value of -1 would indicate that this region should be
encoded with the best possible quality regardless of the treatment of
the rest of the frame - that is, should be encoded at a QP of -12.

=item B<clear>

If set to true, remove any existing regions of interest marked on the
frame before adding the new one.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Mark the centre quarter of the frame as interesting.
	
	addroi=iw/4:ih/4:iw/2:ih/2:-1/10


=item *

Mark the 100-pixel-wide region on the left edge of the frame as very
uninteresting (to be encoded at much lower quality than the rest of
the frame).
	
	addroi=0:0:100:ih:+1/5


=back



=head2 alphaextract


Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
is especially useful with the I<alphamerge> filter.


=head2 alphamerge


Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
I<alphaextract> to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha
channel.

For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with I<alphaextract>, you might use:
	
	movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]

=head2 blackdetect


Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be
useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid
recordings.

The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as
frame metadata. If a black segment of at least the specified minimum
duration is found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well
as duration is printed to the log with level C<info>. In addition,
a log line with level C<debug> is printed per frame showing the
black amount detected for that frame.

The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black
segment with key C<lavfi.black_start> and to the first frame
after the black segment ends with key C<lavfi.black_end>. The
value is the frame's timestamp. This metadata is added regardless
of the minimum duration specified.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<black_min_duration, d>

Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must
be a non-negative floating point number.

Default value is 2.0.


=item B<picture_black_ratio_th, pic_th>

for which a picture is considered black.
Default value is 0.98.


=item B<pixel_black_th, pix_th>

Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black".

The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luminance value for which a
pixel is considered "black". The provided value is scaled according to
the following equation:
	
	<absolute_threshold> = <luminance_minimum_value> + <pixel_black_th> * <luminance_range_size>


I<luminance_range_size> and I<luminance_minimum_value> depend on
the input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV full-range
formats and [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats.

Default value is 0.10.

=back


The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum
value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:
	
	blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00



=head2 blackframe


Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to
detect chapter transitions or commercials. Output lines consist of
the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness,
the position in the file if known or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

This filter exports frame metadata C<lavfi.blackframe.pblack>.
The value represents the percentage of pixels in the picture that
are below the threshold value.

=head2 blend


Blend two video frames into each other.

The C<blend> filter takes two input streams and outputs one
stream, the first input is the "top" layer and second input is
"bottom" layer.  By default, the output terminates when the longest input terminates.

The C<tblend> (time blend) filter takes two consecutive frames
from one single stream, and outputs the result obtained by blending
the new frame on top of the old frame.

The filter converts the transfer characteristics, color space and color
primaries to the specified user values. The output value, if not specified,
is set to a default value based on the "all" property. If that property is
also not specified, the filter will log an error. The output color range and
format default to the same value as the input color range and format. The
input transfer characteristics, color space, color primaries and color range
should be set on the input data. If any of these are missing, the filter will
log an error and no conversion will take place.

For example to convert the input to SMPTE-240M, use the command:
	
	colorspace=smpte240m

testing purposes.



=head2 coreimage

Video filtering on GPU using Apple's CoreImage API on OSX.

Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is
processed by video hardware. However, software-based OpenGL implementations
exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It depends on
the respective OSX.

There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a
large variety of options. The filter has to be referenced by its name along
with its options.

The coreimage filter accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<list_filters>

List all available filters and generators along with all their respective
options as well as possible minimum and maximum values along with the default
values.
	
	list_filters=true



=item B<filter>

Specify all filters by their respective name and options.
Use I<list_filters> to determine all valid filter names and options.
Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped
to their respective value range.  Vector and color options have to be specified
by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done.
A special option name C<default> is available to use default options for a
filter.

It is required to specify either C<default> or at least one of the filter options.
All omitted options are used with their default values.
The syntax of the filter string is as follows:
	
	filter=<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...][#<NAME>@<OPTION>=<VALUE>[@<OPTION>=<VALUE>][@...]][#...]



=item B<output_rect>

Specify a rectangle where the output of the filter chain is copied into the
input image. It is given by a list of space separated float values:
	
	output_rect=x\ y\ width\ height

If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image.
The output rectangle is automatically cropped at the borders of the input
image. Negative values are valid for each component.
	
	output_rect=25\ 25\ 100\ 100


=back


Several filters can be chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST
transfers allowing for fast processing of complex filter chains.
Currently, only filters with zero (generators) or exactly one (filters) input
image and one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet
usable as intended.

Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the
respective filter kernel. The padding is automatically removed to ensure the
filter output has the same size as the input image.

For image generators, the size of the output image is determined by the
previous output image of the filter chain or the input image of the whole
filterchain, respectively. The generators do not use the pixel information of
this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is
blended onto this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the
output image.

The B<coreimagesrc> video source can be used for generating input images
which are directly fed into the filter chain. By using it, providing input
images by another video source or an input video is not required.

=head2 crop


Crop the input video to given dimensions.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<w, out_w>

The width of the output video. It defaults to C<iw>.
This expression is evaluated only once during the filter
configuration, or when the B<w> or B<out_w> command is sent.


=item B<h, out_h>

The height of the output video. It defaults to C<ih>.
This expression is evaluated only once during the filter
configuration, or when the B<h> or B<out_h> command is sent.


=item B<x>

The horizontal position, in the input video, of the left edge of the output
video. It defaults to C<(in_w-out_w)/2>.
This expression is evaluated per-frame.


=item B<y>

The vertical position, in the input video, of the top edge of the output video.
It defaults to C<(in_h-out_h)/2>.
This expression is evaluated per-frame.


=item B<keep_aspect>

If set to 1 will force the output display aspect ratio
to be the same of the input, by changing the output sample aspect
ratio. It defaults to 0.


=item B<exact>

Enable exact cropping. If enabled, subsampled videos will be cropped at exact
width/height/x/y as specified and will not be rounded to nearest smaller value.
It defaults to 0.

=back


The I<out_w>, I<out_h>, I<x>, I<y> parameters are
expressions containing the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<x>

The computed values for I<x> and I<y>. They are evaluated for
each new frame.


=item B<in_w>


=item B<in_h>

The input width and height.


=item B<iw>


=item B<ih>

These are the same as I<in_w> and I<in_h>.


=item B<out_w>


=item B<out_h>

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.


=item B<n>

=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown


=item B<t>

=back


The expression for I<out_w> may depend on the value of I<out_h>,
and the expression for I<out_h> may depend on I<out_w>, but they
cannot depend on I<x> and I<y>, as I<x> and I<y> are
evaluated after I<out_w> and I<out_h>.

The I<x> and I<y> parameters specify the expressions for the
position of the top-left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They
are evaluated for each frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it
is approximated to the nearest valid value.

The expression for I<x> may depend on I<y>, and the expression
for I<y> may depend on I<x>.

in the input video.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

=back



=head2 cropdetect


Auto-detect the crop size.

It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the
recommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions
correspond to the non-black area of the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<limit>

Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified
from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity
value greater to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24.
You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending
on the bitdepth of the pixel format.


=item B<round>

The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to
16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to
get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when
encoding to most video codecs.


=item B<skip>

Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is skipped.
Default is 2. Range is 0 to INT_MAX.


=item B<reset_count, reset>

Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will
reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to
detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.

This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
indicates 'never reset', and returns the largest area encountered during
playback.

=back




=head2 cue


Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first
passes on B<preroll> amount of frames, then it buffers at most
B<buffer> amount of frames and waits for the cue. After reaching the cue
it forwards the buffered frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its
input.

The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for
realtime output devices like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering
chain and pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output almost
immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.

Perfect frame accuracy cannot be guaranteed, but the result is good enough for
some use cases.


=over 4



=item B<cue>

The cue timestamp expressed in a UNIX timestamp in microseconds. Default is 0.


=item B<preroll>

The duration of content to pass on as preroll expressed in seconds. Default is 0.


=item B<buffer>

The maximum duration of content to buffer before waiting for the cue expressed
in seconds. Default is 0.


=back




=head2 curves


Apply color adjustments using curves.

This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each
component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by I<N> key points
tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel
values from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to be set for
the output frame.

By default, a component curve is defined by the two points I<(0;0)> and
I<(1;1)>. This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is
"adjusted" to its own value, which means no change to the image.

The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
curve (using a natural cubic spline interpolation) will be define to pass
smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points needs to be
strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their I<x> and I<y> values must
be in the I<[0;1]> interval.  If the computed curves happened to go outside
the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<preset>

Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition
to the B<r>, B<g>, B<b> parameters; in this case, the later
options takes priority on the preset values.

Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It
is sometimes called a "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with
B<r>, B<g>, B<b> or B<all> since it acts like a

=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Increase slightly the middle level of blue:
	
	curves=blue='0/0 0.5/0.58 1/1'



=item *

=item I<red>

C<(0;0.11) (0.42;0.51) (1;0.95)>

=item I<green>

C<(0;0) (0.50;0.48) (1;1)>

=item I<blue>

value.


=head2 dctdnoiz


Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).

This filter is not designed for real time.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sigma, s>

Set the noise sigma constant.

This I<sigma> defines a hard threshold of C<3 * sigma>; every DCT
coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.

If you need a more advanced filtering, see B<expr>.

Default is C<0>.


=item B<overlap>

Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you
may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the
risk of various artefacts.

If the overlapping value doesn't permit processing the whole input width or
height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won't be denoised.

Default value is I<blocksize>-1, which is the best possible setting.


=item B<expr, e>

Set the coefficient factor expression.

For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a
multiplier value for the coefficient.

If this is option is set, the B<sigma> option will be ignored.

The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the I<c>
variable.


=item B<n>

Set the I<blocksize> using the number of bits. C<1E<lt>E<lt>I<n>> defines the
I<blocksize>, which is the width and height of the processed blocks.

The default value is I<3> (8x8) and can be raised to I<4> for a
I<blocksize> of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences
on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a
better de-noising.

=back



=head3 Examples


Apply a denoise with a B<sigma> of C<4.5>:
	
	dctdnoiz=4.5


The same operation can be achieved using the expression system:

in range 0 to set value will be used. If negative, exact absolute value
will be used.
The range defines square of four pixels around current pixel.


=item B<direction, d>

Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be compared. If positive,
random direction from 0 to set direction will be picked. If negative, exact of
absolute value will be picked. For example direction 0, -PI or -2*PI radians
will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2 will pick only pixels on same
column.


=item B<blur, b>

If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all four
surrounding pixels. The default is enabled. If disabled current pixel is
compared with all four surrounding pixels. The pixel is considered banded
if only all four differences with surrounding pixels are less than threshold.


=item B<coupling, c>

If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all pixel components are banded,
e.g. banding detection threshold is triggered for all color components.

the input width and height. It defaults to 0.


=item B<color, c>

Specify the color of the box to write. For the general syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>. If the special
value C<invert> is used, the box edge color is the same as the
video with inverted luma.

The expression which sets the thickness of the box edge.
A value of C<fill> will create a filled box. Default value is C<3>.

See below for the list of accepted constants.


=item B<replace>

Applicable if the input has alpha. With value C<1>, the pixels of the painted box
will overwrite the video's color and alpha pixels.
Default is C<0>, which composites the box onto the input, leaving the video's alpha intact.

=back




=head3 Text expansion


If B<expansion> is set to C<strftime>,
the filter recognizes strftime() sequences in the provided text and
expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of strftime(). This
feature is deprecated.

If B<expansion> is set to C<none>, the text is printed verbatim.

If B<expansion> is set to C<normal> (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.

The backslash character B<\>, followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.

Sequences of the form C<%{...}> are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ':'.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':' or '}'),
they should be escaped.

Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the
B<text> option in the filter argument string and as the filter
argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell,
that makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file avoids these
problems.

The following functions are available:


=over 4



=item B<expr, e>

The expression evaluation result.

It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the I<x> and
I<y> values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants I<text_w> and I<text_h> will have an undefined
value.


=item B<expr_int_format, eif>

Evaluate the expression's value and output as formatted integer.

The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the I<expr> function.
The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are B<x>,
B<X>, B<d> and B<u>. They are treated exactly as in the
C<printf> function.
The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output.
It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.


=item B<gmtime>

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.
It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.


=item B<localtime>

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone.
It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.


=item B<metadata>

Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.

The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.

The second argument is optional and specifies a default value, used when the
metadata key is not found or empty.

Available metadata can be identified by inspecting entries
starting with TAG included within each frame section
printed by running C<ffprobe -show_frames>.

String metadata generated in filters leading to
the drawtext filter are also available.


=item B<n, frame_num>

The frame number, starting from 0.


=item B<pict_type>

A one character description of the current picture type.


=item B<pts>

The timestamp of the current frame.
It can take up to three arguments.

The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to C<flt>
for seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; C<hms> stands
for a formatted I<[-]HH:MM:SS.mmm> timestamp with millisecond accuracy.
C<gmtime> stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as UTC time;
C<localtime> stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as
local time zone time.

The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.

If the format is set to C<hms>, a third argument C<24HH> may be
supplied to present the hour part of the formatted timestamp in 24h format
(00-23).

If the format is set to C<localtime> or C<gmtime>,
a third argument may be supplied: a strftime() format string.
By default, I<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS> format will be used.

=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports altering parameters via commands:

=over 4


=item B<reinit>

Alter existing filter parameters.

Syntax for the argument is the same as for filter invocation, e.g.

	
	fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text='Hello World'


Full filter invocation with sendcmd would look like this:

	
	sendcmd=c='56.0 drawtext reinit fontsize=56\:fontcolor=green\:text=Hello\\ World'


=back


If the entire argument can't be parsed or applied as valid values then the filter will
continue with its existing parameters.

=head2 fieldmatch


Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine C<fieldmatch> needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as B<decimate> in the filtergraph.

The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
C<fieldmatch> will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as B<yadif> before decimation.

In addition to the various configuration options, C<fieldmatch> can take an
optional second stream, activated through the B<ppsrc> option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.

Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project)
and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from
which C<fieldmatch> is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.

The B<decimate> filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.
If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower
framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr
stream: C<dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate>.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<order>

Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Auto detect parity (use FFmpeg's internal parity value).

=item B<bff>

Assume bottom field first.

=item B<tff>

Assume top field first.

=back


Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the
stream.

Default value is I<auto>.


=item B<mode>

Set the matching mode or strategy to use. B<pc> mode is the safest in the
sense that it won't risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when
possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up
outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other
hand, B<pcn_ub> mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness,
but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are
all somewhere in between B<pc> and B<pcn_ub> in terms of risking
jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections
with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in B<p/c/n/u/b meaning> section.

Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<pc>

2-way matching (p/c)

=item B<pc_n>

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed (p/c + n)

=item B<pc_u>

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if still combed (p/c + u)

=item B<pc_n_ub>

2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and trying 4th/5th matches if
still combed (p/c + n + u/b)

=item B<pcn>

3-way matching (p/c/n)

=item B<pcn_ub>

3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of the original matches are
detected as combed (p/c/n + u/b)

=back


The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that
mode assuming B<order>=I<tff> (and B<field> on I<auto> or
I<top>).

In terms of speed B<pc> mode is by far the fastest and B<pcn_ub> is
the slowest.

Default value is I<pc_n>.


=item B<ppsrc>

Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary
input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter
introduction for more details. It is similar to the B<clip2> feature from
VFM/TFM.

Default value is C<0> (disabled).


=item B<field>

Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as
B<order> unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In
certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a
large impact on matching performance. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Automatic (same value as B<order>).

=item B<bottom>

Match from the bottom field.

=item B<top>

Match from the top field.

=back


Default value is I<auto>.


=item B<mchroma>

Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most
cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to C<0>
only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other
artifacts. Setting this to C<0> could also be used to speed things up at
the cost of some accuracy.

Default value is C<1>.


=item B<y0>


=item B<y1>

These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between B<y0> and
B<y1> from being included in the field matching decision. An exclusion
band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may
interfere with the matching. B<y0> sets the starting scan line and
B<y1> sets the ending line; all lines in between B<y0> and
B<y1> (including B<y0> and B<y1>) will be ignored. Setting
B<y0> and B<y1> to the same value will disable the feature.
B<y0> and B<y1> defaults to C<0>.


=item B<scthresh>

Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on
the luma plane. Good values are in the C<[8.0, 14.0]> range. Scene change
detection is only relevant in case B<combmatch>=I<sc>.  The range for
B<scthresh> is C<[0.0, 100.0]>.

Default value is C<12.0>.


=item B<combmatch>

When B<combatch> is not I<none>, C<fieldmatch> will take into
account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the
final match. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<none>

No final matching based on combed scores.

=item B<sc>

Combed scores are only used when a scene change is detected.

=item B<full>

Use combed scores all the time.

=back


Default is I<sc>.


=item B<combdbg>

Force C<fieldmatch> to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and
print them. This setting is known as B<micout> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.
Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<none>

No forced calculation.

=item B<pcn>

Force p/c/n calculations.

=item B<pcnub>

Force p/c/n/u/b calculations.

=back


Default value is I<none>.


=item B<cthresh>

This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This
essentially controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected.
Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing
can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from
C<-1> (every pixel will be detected as combed) to C<255> (no pixel will
be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good
range is C<[8, 12]>.

Default value is C<9>.


=item B<chroma>

Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision.  Only
disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are
causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually,
using B<chroma>=I<0> is usually more reliable, except for the case
where there is chroma only combing in the source.

Default value is C<0>.


=item B<blockx>


=item B<blocky>

Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed
frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which
B<combpel> pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be
declared combed. See the B<combpel> parameter description for more info.
Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up
to 512.

Default value is C<16>.


=item B<combpel>

The number of combed pixels inside any of the B<blocky> by
B<blockx> size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as
combed. While B<cthresh> controls how "visible" the combing must be, this
setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a
window defined by the B<blockx> and B<blocky> settings) on the
frame. Minimum value is C<0> and maximum is C<blocky x blockx> (at
which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known
as B<MI> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.

Default value is C<80>.

=back




=head3 p/c/n/u/b meaning



=head4 p/c/n


We assume the following telecined stream:

	
	Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
	Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4


The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the
first two frames are progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.

When C<fieldmatch> is configured to run a matching from bottom
(B<field>=I<bottom>) this is how this input stream get transformed:

	
	Input stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4
	                B     1 2 3 4 4   <-- matching reference
	
	Matches:              c c n n c
	
	Output stream:
	                T     1 2 3 4 4
	                B     1 2 3 4 4


As a result of the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated.
To perform a complete inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter
after this operation. See for instance the B<decimate> filter.

The same operation now matching from top fields (B<field>=I<top>)
looks like this:

	
	Input stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4   <-- matching reference
	                B     1 2 3 4 4
	
	Matches:              c c p p c
	
	Output stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4
	                B     1 2 2 3 4


In these examples, we can see what I<p>, I<c> and I<n> mean;
basically, they refer to the frame and field of the opposite parity:


=over 4

=head4 u/b


The I<u> and I<b> matching are a bit special in the sense that they match
from the opposite parity flag. In the following examples, we assume that we are
currently matching the 2nd frame (Top:2, bottom:2). According to the match, a
'x' is placed above and below each matched fields.

With bottom matching (B<field>=I<bottom>):
	
	Match:           c         p           n          b          u

=head3 Examples


Simple IVTC of a top field first telecined stream:
	
	fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=none, decimate


Advanced IVTC, with fallback on B<yadif> for still combed frames:
	
	fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=full, yadif=deint=interlaced, decimate



=head2 fieldorder


Transform the field order of the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<order>

The output field order. Valid values are I<tff> for top field first or I<bff>
for bottom field first.

=back


The default value is B<tff>.

The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down
by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content.
This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.

If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does
not alter the incoming video.

It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material,
which is bottom field first.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv

=item B<fps>

The desired output frame rate. The default is C<25>.


=item B<start_time>

Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for
padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made
about the first frame's expected PTS, so no padding or trimming is done.

=head2 framerate


Change the frame rate by interpolating new video output frames from the source
frames.

This filter is not designed to function correctly with interlaced media. If
you wish to change the frame rate of interlaced media then you are required
to deinterlace before this filter and re-interlace after this filter.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<fps>

Specify the output frames per second. This option can also be specified
as a value alone. The default is C<50>.

linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [C<0>-C<255>],
the default is C<15>.


=item B<interp_end>

Specify the end of a range where the output frame will be created as a
linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [C<0>-C<255>],
the default is C<240>.


=item B<scene>

Specify the level at which a scene change is detected as a value between
0 and 100 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low
probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher
value means the current frame is more likely to be one.
The default is C<8.2>.


=item B<flags>

Specify flags influencing the filter process.

Available value for I<flags> is:


=over 4

=back



=head2 freezedetect


Detect frozen video.

This filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects that the
input video has no significant change in content during a specified duration.
Video freeze detection calculates the mean average absolute difference of all
the components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The
C<lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start> metadata key is set on the first frame
whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the
timestamp of the first frame of the freeze. The
C<lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration> and
C<lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end> metadata keys are set on the first frame
after the freeze.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<noise, n>

Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the
specified value) or as a difference ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or
0.001.

To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to install the frei0r
header and configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-frei0r>.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<filter_name>

The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable
B<FREI0R_PATH> is defined, the frei0r effect is searched for in each of the
directories specified by the colon-separated list in B<FREI0R_PATH>.
Otherwise, the standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order:
F<HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/>, F</usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/>,
F</usr/lib/frei0r-1/>.


=item B<filter_params>

A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is either
"y" or "n"), a double, a color (specified as
I<R>/I<G>/I<B>, where I<R>, I<G>, and I<B> are floating point
numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) or a color description as specified in the
B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>,
a position (specified as I<X>/I<Y>, where
I<X> and I<Y> are floating point numbers) and/or a string.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the B<filter_params> option as B<commands>.


=head2 fspp


Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of B<spp>.

It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post-
processing filter, one of them is performed once per block, not per pixel.
This allows for much higher speed.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<quality>

Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 4-5. Default value is C<4>.


=item B<qp>

Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an integer in range 0-63.
If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).


=item B<strength>

Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15 to 32. Lower values mean
more details but also more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother
but also blurrier. Default value is C<0> − PSNR optimal.


=item B<use_bframe_qp>

Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to C<1>. Using this
option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is
C<0> (not enabled).


=back



=head2 gblur

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sigma>

Set horizontal sigma, standard deviation of Gaussian blur. Default is C<0.5>.

=item B<sigmaV>

Set vertical sigma, if negative it will be same as C<sigma>.
Default is C<-1>.

=back



=head3 Commands

=item B<blue_expr, b>

Set the blue expression.

=back


The colorspace is selected according to the specified options. If one
of the B<lum_expr>, B<cb_expr>, or B<cr_expr>
options is specified, the filter will automatically select a YCbCr
colorspace. If one of the B<red_expr>, B<green_expr>, or
B<blue_expr> options is specified, it will select an RGB
colorspace.

If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on the other
one. If no alpha expression is specified it will evaluate to opaque value.
If none of chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate
to the luminance expression.

The expressions can use the following variables and functions:


=over 4


=item B<N>

=item B<X>


=item B<Y>

The coordinates of the current sample.


=item B<W>


=item B<H>

The width and height of the image.


=item B<SW>


=item B<SH>

=item B<bilinear, b>


=back

Default is bilinear.

=back


For functions, if I<x> and I<y> are outside the area, the value will be
automatically clipped to the closer edge.

Please note that this filter can use multiple threads in which case each slice
will have its own expression state. If you want to use only a single expression
state because your expressions depend on previous state then you should limit
the number of filter threads to 1.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Flip the image horizontally:
	
	geq=p(W-X\,Y)

=back



=head2 gradfun


Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
regions by truncation to 8-bit color depth.
Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and
dither them.

It is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to
lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and
bring back the bands.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<strength>

The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also
the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from
.51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the
valid range.


=item B<radius>

The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes for smoother
gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed
regions. Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16. Out-of-range
values will be clipped to the valid range.


=back


Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
I<strength>[:I<radius>]

Force termination when the shortest input terminates. Default is C<0>.

=item B<repeatlast>

Continue applying the last CLUT after the end of the stream. A value of
C<0> disable the filter after the last frame of the CLUT is reached.
Default is C<1>.

=back


C<haldclut> also has the same interpolation options as B<lut3d> (both
filters share the same internals).

This filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

More information about the Hald CLUT can be found on Eskil Steenberg's website
(Hald CLUT author) at E<lt>B<http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html>E<gt>.

=head4 Hald CLUT video stream


Generate an identity Hald CLUT stream altered with various effects:
	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B<haldclutsrc>=8 -vf "hue=H=2*PI*t:s=sin(2*PI*t)+1, curves=cross_process" -t 10 -c:v ffv1 clut.nut


Note: make sure you use a lossless codec.

Then use it with C<haldclut> to apply it on some random stream:
	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i mandelbrot -i clut.nut -filter_complex '[0][1] haldclut' -t 20 mandelclut.mkv


The Hald CLUT will be applied to the 10 first seconds (duration of
F<clut.nut>), then the latest picture of that CLUT stream will be applied
to the remaining frames of the C<mandelbrot> stream.


=head4 Hald CLUT with preview


A Hald CLUT is supposed to be a squared image of C<Level*Level*Level> by
C<Level*Level*Level> pixels. For a given Hald CLUT, FFmpeg will select the
biggest possible square starting at the top left of the picture. The remaining
padding pixels (bottom or right) will be ignored. This area can be used to add
a preview of the Hald CLUT.

Typically, the following generated Hald CLUT will be supported by the
C<haldclut> filter:

	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B<haldclutsrc>=8 -vf "
	   pad=iw+320 [padded_clut];
	   smptebars=s=320x256, split [a][b];
	   [padded_clut][a] overlay=W-320:h, curves=color_negative [main];
	   [main][b] overlay=W-320" -frames:v 1 clut.png


It contains the original and a preview of the effect of the CLUT: SMPTE color
bars are displayed on the right-top, and below the same color bars processed by
the color changes.

Then, the effect of this Hald CLUT can be visualized with:
	
	ffplay input.mkv -vf "movie=clut.png, [in] haldclut"



=head2 hflip


Flip the input video horizontally.

For example, to horizontally flip the input video with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "hflip" out.avi



=head2 histeq

This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a
per-frame basis.

It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an "automatically adjusting contrast filter". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<strength>

Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.


=item B<intensity>

Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately.  The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.


=item B<antibanding>

Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary
the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of
the histogram. Possible values are C<none>, C<weak> or
C<strong>. It defaults to C<none>.

=back




=head2 histogram


Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.

The computed histogram is a representation of the color component
distribution in an image.

Standard histogram displays the color components distribution in an image.
Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of
the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the
current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<level_height>

Set height of level. Default value is C<200>.
Allowed range is [50, 2048].


=item B<scale_height>

Set height of color scale. Default value is C<12>.
Allowed range is [0, 40].


=item B<display_mode>

Set display mode.
It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<stack>

Per color component graphs are placed below each other.


=item B<parade>

Per color component graphs are placed side by side.


=item B<overlay>

Presents information identical to that in the C<parade>, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

=back

Default is C<stack>.


=item B<levels_mode>

Set mode. Can be either C<linear>, or C<logarithmic>.
Default is C<linear>.


=item B<components>

Set what color components to display.
Default is C<7>.


=item B<fgopacity>

Set foreground opacity. Default is C<0.7>.


=item B<bgopacity>

Set background opacity. Default is C<0.5>.

=head2 hqdn3d


This is a high precision/quality 3d denoise filter. It aims to reduce
image noise, producing smooth images and making still images really
still. It should enhance compressibility.

It accepts the following optional parameters:


=over 4


=item B<luma_spatial>

A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial luma strength.
It defaults to 4.0.


=item B<chroma_spatial>

A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial chroma strength.
It defaults to 3.0*I<luma_spatial>/4.0.


=item B<luma_tmp>

=item B<chroma_tmp>

A floating point number which specifies chroma temporal strength. It defaults to
I<luma_tmp>*I<chroma_spatial>/I<luma_spatial>.

=back



=head3 Commands

This filter supports same B<commands> as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.



=head2 hwdownload


Download hardware frames to system memory.

The input must be in hardware frames, and the output a non-hardware format.
Not all formats will be supported on the output - it may be necessary to insert
an additional B<format> filter immediately following in the graph to get
the output in a supported format.


=head2 hwmap


Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.

This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends
on the input and output formats:

=over 4


=item *

Hardware frame input, normal frame output

Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output.  If the
original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying
something else on part of it), the B<hwmap> filter can be used again
in the next mode to retrieve it.

=item *

Normal frame input, hardware frame output

If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it -
that is, return the original hardware frame.

Otherwise, a device must be provided.  Create new hardware surfaces on that
device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input
and give those frames to the preceding filter.  This will then act like the
B<hwupload> filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when
the input is already in a compatible format.

=item *

Hardware frame input and output

A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the
B<derive_device> option.  The input and output devices must be of
different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is
system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap
to retrieve the original frames.

Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames
on the output corresponding to the frames on the input.

=back


The following additional parameters are accepted:


=over 4


=item B<mode>

Set the frame mapping mode.  Some combination of:

=over 4


=item I<read>

The mapped frame should be readable.

=item I<write>

The mapped frame should be writeable.

=item I<overwrite>

The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame.

This may improve performance in some cases, as the original contents of the
frame need not be loaded.

=item I<direct>

The mapping must not involve any copying.

Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either
direct mapping is not possible or it would have unexpected properties.
Setting this flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail if that is
not possible.

=back

Defaults to I<read+write> if not specified.


=item B<derive_device> I<type>

Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type I<type> from the device the input frames exist on.


=item B<reverse>

In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the sink
and map them back to the source.  This may be necessary in some cases where
a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is
supported by the devices being used.

This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding filter in undefined
ways if there are any additional constraints on that filter's output.
Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.

=back




=head2 hwupload


Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.

The device to upload to must be supplied when the filter is initialised.  If
using ffmpeg, select the appropriate device with the B<-filter_hw_device>
option or with the B<derive_device> option.  The input and output devices
must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is
system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

The following additional parameters are accepted:


=over 4


=item B<derive_device> I<type>

Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type I<type> from the device the input frames exist on.

to create same output.

The filter accepts the following option:


=over 4

Specify the hue angle as a number of radians. It accepts an
expression, and defaults to "0".


=item B<b>

Specify the brightness in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and

specified at the same time.

The B<b>, B<h>, B<H> and B<s> option values are
expressions containing the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<n>

frame count of the input frame starting from 0

=item *

Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-in effect starting at 0:
	
	hue="s=min(t/3\,1)"


The general fade-in expression can be written as:

This makes it possible to build more robust edge masks.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<planes>

Set which planes will be processed as bitmap, unprocessed planes will be
copied from first stream.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.


=item B<threshold>

Set threshold which is used in filtering. If pixel component value is higher than
this value filter algorithm for connecting components is activated.
By default value is 0.

=back


The C<hysteresis> filter also supports the B<framesync> options.


=head2 identity


Obtain the identity score between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained per component, average, min and max identity score is printed through
the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated identity scores of each frame in frame metadata.

In the below example the input file F<main.mpg> being processed is compared
with the reference file F<ref.mpg>.

	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi identity -f null -



=head2 idet


Detect video interlacing type.

This filter tries to detect if the input frames are interlaced, progressive,
top or bottom field first. It will also try to detect fields that are
repeated between adjacent frames (a sign of telecine).

Single frame detection considers only immediately adjacent frames when classifying each frame.
Multiple frame detection incorporates the classification history of previous frames.

The filter will log these metadata values:


=over 4


=item B<single.current_frame>

Detected type of current frame using single-frame detection. One of:
``tff'' (top field first), ``bff'' (bottom field first),
``progressive'', or ``undetermined''


=item B<single.tff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.tff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using multiple-frame detection.


=item B<single.bff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.current_frame>

Detected type of current frame using multiple-frame detection. One of:
``tff'' (top field first), ``bff'' (bottom field first),
``progressive'', or ``undetermined''


=item B<multiple.bff>

Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using multiple-frame detection.


=item B<single.progressive>

Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.progressive>

Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using multiple-frame detection.


=item B<single.undetermined>

Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using single-frame detection.


=item B<multiple.undetermined>

Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using multiple-frame detection.


=item B<repeated.current_frame>

Which field in the current frame is repeated from the last. One of ``neither'', ``top'', or ``bottom''.


=item B<repeated.neither>

Cumulative number of frames with no repeated field.


=item B<repeated.top>

Cumulative number of frames with the top field repeated from the previous frame's top field.


=item B<repeated.bottom>

Cumulative number of frames with the bottom field repeated from the previous frame's bottom field.

=back


The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<intl_thres>

Set interlacing threshold.

=item B<prog_thres>

Set progressive threshold.

=item B<rep_thres>

Threshold for repeated field detection.

=item B<half_life>

Number of frames after which a given frame's contribution to the
statistics is halved (i.e., it contributes only 0.5 to its
classification). The default of 0 means that all frames seen are given
full weight of 1.0 forever.

=item B<analyze_interlaced_flag>

When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine
if the interlaced flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames.
If the flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any further
computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it will be cleared without any
further computations. This allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational
method to clean up the interlaced flag

=back



=head2 il


Deinterleave or interleave fields.

This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields without
deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input frame into 2
fields (so called half pictures). Odd lines are moved to the top
half of the output image, even lines to the bottom half.
You can process (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<luma_mode, l>


=item B<chroma_mode, c>


=item B<alpha_mode, a>

Available values for I<luma_mode>, I<chroma_mode> and

=head2 lenscorrection


Correct radial lens distortion

This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use
of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters
one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error.
To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources
and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.

Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and
Digikam from the KDE project.

In contrast to the B<vignette> filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,
this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas B<vignette> corrects the
brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain
cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should
be applied before or after lens correction.


=head3 Options


The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<cx>

Relative x-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
width. Default is 0.5.

=item B<cy>

Relative y-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
height. Default is 0.5.

=item B<k1>

Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means
no correction. Default is 0.

=item B<k2>

Coefficient of the double quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1].
0 means no correction. Default is 0.

=item B<i>

Set interpolation type. Can be C<nearest> or C<bilinear>.
Default is C<nearest>.

=item B<fc>

Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual>. Default color is C<black@0>.

=back


The formula that generates the correction is:

I<r_src> = I<r_tgt> * (1 + I<k1> * (I<r_tgt> / I<r_0>)^2 + I<k2> * (I<r_tgt> / I<r_0>)^4)

where I<r_0> is halve of the image diagonal and I<r_src> and I<r_tgt> are the
distances from the focal point in the source and target images, respectively.


=head3 Commands


This filter supports the all above options as B<commands>.


=head2 lensfun


Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (E<lt>B<http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/>E<gt>).

The C<lensfun> filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model
to apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and
query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As
long as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can
perform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the
filter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will
output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level "info"). You must
provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<make>

The make of the camera (for example, "Canon"). This option is required.


=item B<model>

The model of the camera (for example, "Canon EOS 100D"). This option is
required.


=item B<lens_model>

The model of the lens (for example, "Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM"). This
option is required.


=item B<mode>

=item B<vig_subpixel>

Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations.


=item B<distortion>

Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations.


=item B<all>

Enables all possible corrections.


=back


=item B<focal_length>

The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For
example, a 18--55mm lens has focal length range of [18--55], so a value in that
range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.


=item B<aperture>

The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.


=item B<focus_distance>

is smaller than number of I<frames> last specified
weight will be used for all remaining unset weights.


=item B<scale>

Specify scale, if it is set it will be multiplied with sum
of each weight multiplied with pixel values to give final destination
pixel value. By default I<scale> is auto scaled to sum of weights.


=item B<duration>

Specify how end of stream is determined.

=over 4


=item B<longest>

The duration of the longest input. (default)


=item B<shortest>

=item B<cb>

Set the chroma blue spot. Allowed range is from -1 to 1.
Default value is 0.


=item B<cr>

Set the chroma red spot. Allowed range is from -1 to 1.
Default value is 0.

=head2 mpdecimate


Drop frames that do not differ greatly from the previous frame in
order to reduce frame rate.

The main use of this filter is for very-low-bitrate encoding
(e.g. streaming over dialup modem), but it could in theory be used for
fixing movies that were inverse-telecined incorrectly.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<max>

Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped (if
positive), or the minimum interval between dropped frames (if
negative). If the value is 0, the frame is dropped disregarding the
number of previous sequentially dropped frames.

Default value is 0.


=item B<hi>


=item B<lo>


=item B<frac>

Set the dropping threshold values.

Values for B<hi> and B<lo> are for 8x8 pixel blocks and
represent actual pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64
corresponds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the same spread
out differently over the block.

A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more
than a threshold of B<hi>, and if no more than B<frac> blocks (1
meaning the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of B<lo>.

Default value for B<hi> is 64*12, default value for B<lo> is
64*5, and default value for B<frac> is 0.33.

=back



=head2 msad


Obtain the MSAD (Mean Sum of Absolute Differences) between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained per component, average, min and max MSAD is printed through
the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated MSAD of each frame in frame metadata.

In the below example the input file F<main.mpg> being processed is compared
with the reference file F<ref.mpg>.

	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi msad -f null -



=head2 negate


Negate (invert) the input video.

It accepts the following option:


=over 4



=item B<negate_alpha>

With value 1, it negates the alpha component, if present. Default value is 0.

=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports same B<commands> as options.



=head2 nlmeans


Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm.

Each pixel is adjusted by looking for other pixels with similar contexts. This
context similarity is defined by comparing their surrounding patches of size
B<p>xB<p>. Patches are searched in an area of B<r>xB<r>
around the pixel.

Note that the research area defines centers for patches, which means some
patches will be made of pixels outside that research area.

The filter accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<s>

Set denoising strength. Default is 1.0. Must be in range [1.0, 30.0].


=item B<p>

Set patch size. Default is 7. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].


=item B<pc>

Same as B<p> but for chroma planes.

=item B<r>

Set research size. Default is 15. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].


=item B<rc>

Same as B<r> but for chroma planes.

The default value is I<0> and means automatic.

Can be one of the following:


=over 4


=item B<a, abs>

weights trained to minimize squared error

=back



=item B<pscrn>

Controls whether or not the prescreener neural network is used to decide
which pixels should be processed by the predictor neural network and which
can be handled by simple cubic interpolation.
The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation will be
sufficient for a pixel or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn.
The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of
the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation,
using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing.
The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not
using it is almost always unnoticeable.

Can be one of the following:

=head2 normalize


Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast stretching).
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing)

For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps
it linearly to the user-specified output range. The output range defaults
to the full dynamic range from pure black to pure white.

Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce flickering (rapid
changes in brightness) caused when small dark or bright objects enter or leave
the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a
video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of over- or
under-exposure of the video.

The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which may cause some
color shifting, or linked together as a single channel, which prevents
color shifting. Linked normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization
does not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked
normalization can be combined in any ratio.

The normalize filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<blackpt>


=item B<whitept>

Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to
the I<blackpt>. The maximum input value is mapped to the I<whitept>.
The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for
I<blackpt> and black for I<whitept> will give color-inverted,
normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range
(contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting
effects.


=item B<smoothing>

The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. The input range
of each channel is smoothed using a rolling average over the current frame
and the I<smoothing> previous frames. The default is 0 (no temporal
smoothing).


=item B<independence>

Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting) channel normalization to
linked (color preserving) normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully
independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).


=item B<strength>

Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 is a rather
expensive no-op. Defaults to 1.0 (full strength).


=back



=head3 Commands

This filter supports same B<commands> as options, excluding I<smoothing> option.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.


=head3 Examples


Stretch video contrast to use the full dynamic range, with no temporal
smoothing; may flicker depending on the source content:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=0


As above, but with 50 frames of temporal smoothing; flicker should be
reduced, depending on the source content:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50


As above, but with hue-preserving linked channel normalization:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0


As above, but with half strength:
	
	normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0:strength=0.5


Map the darkest input color to red, the brightest input color to cyan:
	
	normalize=blackpt=red:whitept=cyan



=head2 null

Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise
information:
E<lt>B<http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html>E<gt>

Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.



=head3 dilate


Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function C<cvDilate>.

It accepts the parameters: I<struct_el>|I<nb_iterations>.

I<struct_el> represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
I<cols>xI<rows>+I<anchor_x>xI<anchor_y>/I<shape>

I<cols> and I<rows> represent the number of columns and rows of
the structuring element, I<anchor_x> and I<anchor_y> the anchor
point, and I<shape> the shape for the structuring element. I<shape>
must be "rect", "cross", "ellipse", or "custom".

If the value for I<shape> is "custom", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=I<filename>". The file with name
I<filename> is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
I<shape> is used, I<cols> and I<rows> are ignored, the number
or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.

The default value for I<struct_el> is "3x3+0x0/rect".

I<nb_iterations> specifies the number of times the transform is
applied to the image, and defaults to 1.

Some examples:
	
	# Use the default values
	ocv=dilate
	
	# Dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterating two times
	ocv=filter_name=dilate:filter_params=5x5+2x2/cross|2
	
	# Read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterating two times.
	# The file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this
	#   *
	#  ***
	# *****
	#  ***
	#   *
	# The specified columns and rows are ignored
	# but the anchor point coordinates are not
	ocv=dilate:0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape|2



=head3 erode


Erode an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function C<cvErode>.

It accepts the parameters: I<struct_el>:I<nb_iterations>,
with the same syntax and semantics as the B<dilate> filter.


=head3 smooth


Smooth the input video.

The filter takes the following parameters:
I<type>|I<param1>|I<param2>|I<param3>|I<param4>.

I<type> is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of
the following values: "blur", "blur_no_scale", "median", "gaussian",
or "bilateral". The default value is "gaussian".

The meaning of I<param1>, I<param2>, I<param3>, and I<param4>
depends on the smooth type. I<param1> and
I<param2> accept integer positive values or 0. I<param3> and
I<param4> accept floating point values.

The default value for I<param1> is 3. The default value for the
other parameters is 0.

These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the
libopencv function C<cvSmooth>.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video

=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown


=item B<t>

=back


This filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

Note that the I<n>, I<pos>, I<t> variables are available only
when evaluation is done I<per frame>, and will evaluate to NAN
when B<eval> is set to B<init>.

Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea
to pass the two inputs through a I<setpts=PTS-STARTPTS> filter to
have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for
the I<movie> filter does.

You can chain together more overlays but you should test the
efficiency of such approach.

paddings added. If the value for I<width> or I<height> is 0, the
corresponding input size is used for the output.

The I<width> expression can reference the value set by the
I<height> expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<width> and I<height> is 0.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Specify the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area,
with respect to the top/left border of the output image.

The I<x> expression can reference the value set by the I<y>
expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<x> and I<y> is 0.

If I<x> or I<y> evaluate to a negative number, they'll be changed
so the input image is centered on the padded area.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual>.

The default value of I<color> is "black".


=item B<eval>

Specify when to evaluate  I<width>, I<height>, I<x> and I<y> expression.

It accepts the following values:


=over 4


=item B<init>

Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when
a command is processed.


=item B<frame>

Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.


=back


Default value is B<init>.


=item B<aspect>

Pad to aspect instead to a resolution.


=back


The value for the I<width>, I<height>, I<x>, and I<y>
options are expressions containing the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<in_w>


=item B<in_h>

The input video width and height.


=item B<iw>


=item B<ih>

These are the same as I<in_w> and I<in_h>.


=item B<out_w>


=item B<out_h>

The output width and height (the size of the padded area), as
specified by the I<width> and I<height> expressions.


=item B<ow>


=item B<oh>

These are the same as I<out_w> and I<out_h>.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

The x and y offsets as specified by the I<x> and I<y>
expressions, or NAN if not yet specified.


=item B<a>

same as I<iw> / I<ih>


=item B<sar>

input sample aspect ratio


=item B<dar>

input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (I<iw> / I<ih>) * I<sar>


=item B<hsub>


=item B<vsub>

The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Add paddings with the color "violet" to the input video. The output video
size is 640x480, and the top-left corner of the input video is placed at
column 0, row 40
	
	pad=640:480:0:40:violet


The example above is equivalent to the following command:
	
	pad=width=640:height=480:x=0:y=40:color=violet



=item *

Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2,
and put the input video at the center of the padded area:
	
	pad="3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Pad the input to get a squared output with size equal to the maximum
value between the input width and height, and put the input video at
the center of the padded area:
	
	pad="max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:
	
	pad="ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display aspect
correctly, it is necessary to use I<sar> in the expression,
according to the relation:
	
	(ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
	X = output_dar / sar


Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:
	
	pad="ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Double the output size and put the input video in the bottom-right
corner of the output padded area:
	
	pad="2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih"


=back




=head2 palettegen

Note: the palette will still contain 256 colors; the unused palette entries
will be black.


=item B<reserve_transparent>

Create a palette of 255 colors maximum and reserve the last one for
transparency. Reserving the transparency color is useful for GIF optimization.
If not set, the maximum of colors in the palette will be 256. You probably want
to disable this option for a standalone image.
Set by default.

Set the color that will be used as background for transparency.


=item B<stats_mode>

Set statistics mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4

=back


Default value is I<full>.

=back


The filter also exports the frame metadata C<lavfi.color_quant_ratio>
(C<nb_color_in / nb_color_out>) which you can use to evaluate the degree of
color quantization of the palette. This information is also visible at
I<info> logging level.

=back


Default is I<sierra2_4a>.


=item B<bayer_scale>

When I<bayer> dithering is selected, this option defines the scale of the
pattern (how much the crosshatch pattern is visible). A low value means more
visible pattern for less banding, and higher value means less visible pattern
at the cost of more banding.

The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5]. Default is I<2>.


=item B<diff_mode>

If set, define the zone to process


=over 4


=item B<rectangle>

Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed. This is similar to GIF
cropping/offsetting compression mechanism. This option can be useful for speed
if only a part of the image is changing, and has use cases such as limiting the
scope of the error diffusal B<dither> to the rectangle that bounds the
moving scene (it leads to more deterministic output if the scene doesn't change
much, and as a result less moving noise and better GIF compression).

=back


Default is I<none>.


=item B<new>

Take new palette for each output frame.


=item B<alpha_threshold>

Sets the alpha threshold for transparency. Alpha values above this threshold
will be treated as completely opaque, and values below this threshold will be

=head2 psnr


Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio) between two input videos.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the PSNR.

Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.

The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each
frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames
equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:

	
	PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)


Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the
image.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.


=over 4


=item B<stats_file, f>

If specified the filter will use the named file to save the PSNR of
each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to
standard output.


=item B<stats_version>

Specifies which version of the stats file format to use. Details of
each format are written below.
Default value is 1.


=item B<stats_add_max>

Determines whether the max value is output to the stats log.
Default value is 0.
Requires stats_version E<gt>= 2. If this is set and stats_version E<lt> 2,
the filter will return an error.

=back


This filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

The file printed if I<stats_file> is selected, contains a sequence of
key/value pairs of the form I<key>:I<value> for each compared
couple of frames.

If a I<stats_version> greater than 1 is specified, a header line precedes
the list of per-frame-pair stats, with key value pairs following the frame
format with the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<psnr_log_version>

The version of the log file format. Will match I<stats_version>.


=item B<fields>

For example:
	
	movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
	[main][ref] psnr="stats_file=stats.log" [out]


On this example the input file being processed is compared with the
reference file F<ref_movie.mpg>. The PSNR of each individual frame
is stored in F<stats.log>.


=item *

Another example with different containers:
	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mkv -lavfi  "[0:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[main];[1:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[ref];[main][ref]psnr" -f null -

=head2 pullup


Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed
hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive
content.

The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making
its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock
onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after
pullup, use C<fps=24000/1001> if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,
C<fps=24> for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<jl>


=item B<jr>


=item B<jt>


=item B<jb>

These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and
bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels,
while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.


=item B<sb>

Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of
filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily.
This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between
the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<mp>

Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<l>

Use luma plane.


=item B<u>

Use chroma blue plane.


=item B<v>

Use chroma red plane.

=back


This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane
for doing filter's computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean
source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there

=head2 removelogo


Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which
pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.

=back


Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.

If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.


=head2 repeatfields


This filter uses the repeat_field flag from the Video ES headers and hard repeats
fields based on its value.


=head2 reverse

A description of the optional parameters follows.

=over 4


=item B<angle, a>

Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video

=back


Each chroma option value, if not explicitly specified, is set to the
corresponding luma option value.



=head2 scale


Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.

The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

If the input image format is different from the format requested by
the next filter, the scale filter will convert the input to the
requested format.


=head3 Options

The filter accepts the following options, or any of the options
supported by the libswscale scaler.

See B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for
the complete list of scaler options.


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input
dimension.

If the I<width> or I<w> value is 0, the input width is used for
the output. If the I<height> or I<h> value is 0, the input height
is used for the output.

If one and only one of the values is -n with n E<gt>= 1, the scale filter
will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image,
calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will,
however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and
adjust the value if necessary.

If both values are -n with n E<gt>= 1, the behavior will be identical to
both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.

See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension
expression.


=item B<eval>

Specify when to evaluate I<width> and I<height> expression. It accepts the following values:

Do not apply interlaced scaling.


=item B<-1>

Select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source frames
are flagged as interlaced or not.

=back


Default value is B<0>.


=item B<flags>

Set libswscale scaling flags. See
B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for the
complete list of values. If not explicitly specified the filter applies
the default flags.



=item B<param0, param1>

Set libswscale input parameters for scaling algorithms that need them. See
B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for the
complete documentation. If not explicitly specified the filter applies
empty parameters.

B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.


=item B<in_color_matrix>


=item B<out_color_matrix>

Set in/output YCbCr color space type.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder.

If not specified, the color space type depends on the pixel format.

Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Choose automatically.


=item B<bt709>

Set color space conforming to ITU-R BT.2020 non-constant luminance system.

=back



=item B<in_range>


=item B<out_range>

Set in/output YCbCr sample range.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing
a specific value used for the output and encoder. If not specified, the
range depends on the pixel format. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<auto/unknown>

Choose automatically.


=item B<jpeg/full/pc>

Set full range (0-255 in case of 8-bit luma).

Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.


=item B<decrease>

The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.


=item B<increase>

The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.


=back


One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device's
maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to
that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows
1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for B<w>
or B<h>, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option
to work.


=item B<force_divisible_by>

Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the
given integer when used together with B<force_original_aspect_ratio>. This
works similar to using C<-n> in the B<w> and B<h> options.

This option respects the value set for B<force_original_aspect_ratio>,
increasing or decreasing the resolution accordingly. The video's aspect ratio
may be slightly modified.

This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed
a defined resolution using B<force_original_aspect_ratio> but also have
encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.

=item B<force_divisible_by>

Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the
given integer when used together with B<force_original_aspect_ratio>. This
works similar to using C<-n> in the B<w> and B<h> options.

This option respects the value set for B<force_original_aspect_ratio>,
increasing or decreasing the resolution accordingly. The video's aspect ratio
may be slightly modified.

This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed
a defined resolution using B<force_original_aspect_ratio> but also have
encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.

=head2 separatefields


The C<separatefields> takes a frame-based video input and splits
each frame into its components fields, producing a new half height clip
with twice the frame rate and twice the frame count.

This filter use field-dominance information in frame to decide which
of each pair of fields to place first in the output.
If it gets it wrong use B<setfield> filter before C<separatefields> filter.


=head2 setdar, setsar


The C<setdar> filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter
output video.

This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect
Ratio, according to the following equation:
	
	<DAR> = <HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION> / <VERTICAL_RESOLUTION> * <SAR>


Keep in mind that the C<setdar> filter does not modify the pixel
dimensions of the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by
this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain,
e.g. in case of scaling or if another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is
applied.

The C<setsar> filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for
the filter output video.

Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the
output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation
above.

Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the C<setsar>
filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if
another "setsar" or a "setdar" filter is applied.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<r, ratio, dar (C<setdar> only), sar (C<setsar> only)>

Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.

The parameter can be a floating point number string, an expression, or
a string of the form I<num>:I<den>, where I<num> and
I<den> are the numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. If
the parameter is not specified, it is assumed the value "0".
In case the form "I<num>:I<den>" is used, the C<:> character
should be escaped.


=item B<max>

Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and
denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational.
Default value is C<100>.


=back


The parameter I<sar> is an expression containing
the following constants:

=item B<E, PI, PHI>

These are approximated values for the mathematical constants e
(Euler's number), pi (Greek pi), and phi (the golden ratio).


=item B<w, h>

=item B<a>

These are the same as I<w> / I<h>.


=item B<sar>

=item B<dar>

The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as
(I<w> / I<h>) * I<sar>.

=head2 ssim


Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two input videos.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the SSIM.

Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.


=over 4


=item B<stats_file, f>

If specified the filter will use the named file to save the SSIM of
each individual frame. When filename equals "-" the data is sent to
standard output.

=back


The file printed if I<stats_file> is selected, contains a sequence of
key/value pairs of the form I<key>:I<value> for each compared
couple of frames.

A description of each shown parameter follows:


=over 4


=item B<n>

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1


=item B<Y, U, V, R, G, B>

SSIM of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.

On this example the input file being processed is compared with the
reference file F<ref_movie.mpg>. The SSIM of each individual frame
is stored in F<stats.log>.


=item *

Another example with both psnr and ssim at same time:
	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi  "ssim;[0:v][1:v]psnr" -f null -



=item *

Another example with different containers:
	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mkv -lavfi  "[0:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[main];[1:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[ref];[main][ref]ssim" -f null -

video, use the command:
	
	subtitles=sub.srt


which is equivalent to:
	
	subtitles=filename=sub.srt


To render the default subtitles stream from file F<video.mkv>, use:
	
	subtitles=video.mkv


To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use:
	
	subtitles=video.mkv:si=1


To make the subtitles stream from F<sub.srt> appear in 80% transparent blue
C<DejaVu Serif>, use:
	
	subtitles=sub.srt:force_style='Fontname=DejaVu Serif,PrimaryColour=&HCCFF0000'

Set the frames batch size to analyze; in a set of I<n> frames, the filter
will pick one of them, and then handle the next batch of I<n> frames until
the end. Default is C<100>.

=back


Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger I<n>
value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not recommended.


=head3 Examples



=over 4

=back


Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward
compatibility reasons.

Default mode is C<merge>.


=item B<flags>

Specify flags influencing the filter process.

Available value for I<flags> is:


=over 4


=item B<low_pass_filter, vlpf>

Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the filter.
Vertical low-pass filtering is required when creating an interlaced
destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency
vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace 'twitter' and Moire
patterning.


=item B<complex_filter, cvlpf>

Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering.
This will slightly less reduce interlace 'twitter' and Moire
patterning but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression.


=item B<bypass_il>

Bypass already interlaced frames, only adjust the frame rate.

=back


Vertical low-pass filtering and bypassing already interlaced frames can only be
enabled for B<mode> I<interleave_top> and I<interleave_bottom>.


=back



=head2 tmedian

Pick median pixels from several successive input video frames.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<radius>

Set radius of median filter.
Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.


=item B<planes>

Set which planes to filter. Default value is C<15>, by which all planes are processed.


=item B<percentile>

Set median percentile. Default value is C<0.5>.
Default value of C<0.5> will pick always median values, while C<0> will pick
minimum values, and C<1> maximum values.

=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports all above options as B<commands>, excluding option C<radius>.


=head2 tmidequalizer


Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.

Midway Video Equalization adjusts a sequence of video frames to have the same
histograms, while maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It's
useful for e.g. matching exposures from a video frames sequence.

This filter accepts the following option:


=over 4


=item B<radius>

Set filtering radius. Default is C<5>. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.


=item B<sigma>

Set filtering sigma. Default is C<0.5>. This controls strength of filtering.
Setting this option to 0 effectively does nothing.


=item B<planes>

Set which planes to process. Default is C<15>, which is all available planes.

=back



=head2 tmix


Mix successive video frames.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<frames>

The number of successive frames to mix. If unspecified, it defaults to 3.


=item B<weights>

Specify weight of each input video frame.
Each weight is separated by space. If number of weights is smaller than
number of I<frames> last specified weight will be used for all remaining
unset weights.


=item B<scale>

Specify scale, if it is set it will be multiplied with sum
of each weight multiplied with pixel values to give final destination
pixel value. By default I<scale> is auto scaled to sum of weights.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Average 7 successive frames:
	
	tmix=frames=7:weights="1 1 1 1 1 1 1"



=item *

Apply simple temporal convolution:
	
	tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 3 -1"



=item *

Similar as above but only showing temporal differences:
	
	tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 2 -1":scale=1


=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<weights>


=item B<scale>

Syntax is same as option with same name.

=back




=head2 tonemap

Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.

This filter expects data in single precision floating point, as it needs to
operate on (and can output) out-of-range values. Another filter, such as
B<zscale>, is needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable format.

The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear light, so input
data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf zscale=transfer=linear,tonemap=clip,zscale=transfer=bt709,format=yuv420p OUTPUT



=head3 Options

The filter accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<tonemap>

Set the tone map algorithm to use.

Possible values are:

=over 4


=item I<none>

Do not apply any tone map, only desaturate overbright pixels.


=item I<clip>

Hard-clip any out-of-range values. Use it for perfect color accuracy for
in-range values, while distorting out-of-range values.


=item I<linear>

Stretch the entire reference gamut to a linear multiple of the display.


=item I<gamma>

Fit a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.


=item I<reinhard>

Preserve overall image brightness with a simple curve, using nonlinear
contrast, which results in flattening details and degrading color accuracy.


=item I<hable>

Preserve both dark and bright details better than I<reinhard>, at the cost
of slightly darkening everything. Use it when detail preservation is more
important than color and brightness accuracy.


=item I<mobius>

Smoothly map out-of-range values, while retaining contrast and colors for
in-range material as much as possible. Use it when color accuracy is more
important than detail preservation.

=back


Default is none.


=item B<param>

Tune the tone mapping algorithm.

This affects the following algorithms:

=over 4


=item I<none>

Ignored.


=item I<linear>

Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching.
Default to 1.0.


=item I<gamma>

Specifies the exponent of the function.
Default to 1.8.


=item I<clip>

Specify an extra linear coefficient to multiply into the signal before clipping.
Default to 1.0.


=item I<reinhard>

Specify the local contrast coefficient at the display peak.
Default to 0.5, which means that in-gamut values will be about half as bright
as when clipping.


=item I<hable>

Ignored.


=item I<mobius>

Specify the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every value
below this point is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the
more accurate the result will be, at the cost of losing bright details.
Default to 0.3, which due to the steep initial slope still preserves in-range
colors fairly accurately.

=back



=item B<desat>

Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The
higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This
setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
(smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural,
at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

The default of 2.0 is somewhat conservative and will mostly just apply to
skies or directly sunlit surfaces. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

This option works only if the input frame has a supported color tag.


=item B<peak>

Override signal/nominal/reference peak with this value. Useful when the
embedded peak information in display metadata is not reliable or when tone
mapping from a lower range to a higher range.

=back



=head2 tpad


Temporarily pad video frames.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<start>

Specify number of delay frames before input video stream. Default is 0.


=item B<stop>

Specify number of padding frames after input video stream.
Set to -1 to pad indefinitely. Default is 0.


=item B<start_mode>

Set kind of frames added to beginning of stream.
Can be either I<add> or I<clone>.
With I<add> frames of solid-color are added.
With I<clone> frames are clones of first frame.
Default is I<add>.


=item B<stop_mode>

Set kind of frames added to end of stream.
Can be either I<add> or I<clone>.
With I<add> frames of solid-color are added.
With I<clone> frames are clones of last frame.
Default is I<add>.


=item B<start_duration, stop_duration>

Specify the duration of the start/stop delay. See
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>
for the accepted syntax.
These options override I<start> and I<stop>. Default is 0.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option,
check the B<"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual>.

The default value of I<color> is "black".

=back




=head2 transpose


Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<dir>

Specify the transposition direction.

Can assume the following values:

=over 4


=item B<0, 4, cclock_flip>

Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is:
	
	L.R     R.r
	. . ->  . .
	l.r     L.l



=item B<3, 7, clock_flip>

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:
	
	L.R     r.R
	. . ->  . .
	l.r     l.L


=back


For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if the input
video geometry is portrait and not landscape. These values are
deprecated, the C<passthrough> option should be used instead.

Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in favor of
symbolic constants.


=item B<passthrough>

Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one
specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Always apply transposition.

This is the same as I<start>, except this option sets the start timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.


=item B<end_pts>

This is the same as I<end>, except this option sets the end timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.


=item B<duration>

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.


=item B<start_frame>

The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.


=item B<end_frame>

The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

=back


B<start>, B<end>, and B<duration> are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>
for the accepted syntax.

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the B<duration>
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the
frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify
the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
setpts filter after the trim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

=over 4


=item *

Drop everything except the second minute of input:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120



=item *

Keep only the first second:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1



=back



=head2 unpremultiply

of second stream as alpha.

Both streams must have same dimensions and same pixel format.

The filter accepts the following option:


=over 4


=item B<planes>

Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.
By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

If the format has 1 or 2 components, then luma is bit 0.
If the format has 3 or 4 components:
for RGB formats bit 0 is green, bit 1 is blue and bit 2 is red;
for YUV formats bit 0 is luma, bit 1 is chroma-U and bit 2 is chroma-V.
If present, the alpha channel is always the last bit.


=item B<inplace>

Do not require 2nd input for processing, instead use alpha plane from input stream.

=back




=head2 unsharp

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<luma_msize_x, lx>

3 and 23. The default value is 5.


=item B<luma_msize_y, ly>

Set the luma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd integer between 3
and 23. The default value is 5.


=item B<luma_amount, la>

Set the luma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable
values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

Default value is 1.0.


=item B<chroma_msize_x, cx>

Set the chroma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer
between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.


=item B<chroma_msize_y, cy>

Set the chroma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd integer
between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.


=item B<chroma_amount, ca>

Set the chroma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable
values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

Default value is 0.0.


=back


All parameters are optional and default to the equivalent of the
string '5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0'.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<layout>

Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns). For the syntax of

=over 4


=item *

Produce a 1-second video from a still image file made of 25 frames stacked
vertically, like an analogic film reel:

=back



=head2 uspp


Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses
the image at several (or - in the case of B<quality> level C<8> - all)
shifts and average the results.

The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra only 8x8
DCT similar to MJPEG.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<quality>

Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 0-8. If set to C<0>, the filter will have no
effect. A value of C<8> means the higher quality. For each increment of
that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is
C<3>.

=head3 Commands


This filter supports subset of above options as B<commands>.


=head2 vaguedenoiser


Apply a wavelet based denoiser.

It transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain,
using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to
the obtained coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after.
Due to wavelet properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and
reduced noise, without blurring picture features.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<threshold>

The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be.
Hard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding
before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<hard>

All values under the threshold will be zeroed.

(less) hard thresholding.

=back


Default is garrote.


=item B<nsteps>

Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture. Picture can't
be decomposed beyond a particular point (typically, 8 for a 640x480
frame - as 2^9 = 512 E<gt> 480). Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.

=over 4


=item B<mode, m>

Set vectorscope mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<gray>


=item B<tint>

Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness means more pixels have
same component color value on location in graph. This is the default mode.


=item B<color>

Gray values are displayed on graph. Surrounding pixels values which are not
present in video frame are drawn in gradient of 2 color components which are
set by option C<x> and C<y>. The 3rd color component is static.


=item B<color2>

Actual color components values present in video frame are displayed on graph.


=item B<color3>

Similar as color2 but higher frequency of same values C<x> and C<y>
on graph increases value of another color component, which is luminance by
default values of C<x> and C<y>.


=item B<color4>

Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on graph. If two different
colors map to same position on graph then color with higher value of component
not present in graph is picked.


=item B<color5>

Gray values are displayed on graph. Similar to C<color> but with 3rd color
component picked from radial gradient.

=back



=item B<x>

is 0.1 * 255 = 25.


=item B<hthreshold, h>

Set high threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis.
Values higher than this value will be ignored. Default is 1.
Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component
can have. So for 8-bit input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold
is 0.9 * 255 = 230.

Set color tint for gray/tint vectorscope mode. By default both options are zero.
This means no tint, and output will remain gray.

=back




=head2 vidstabdetect


Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see
B<vidstabtransform> for pass 2.

This filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation
transform information about subsequent frames, which is then used by

=over 4


=item B<result>

Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information.
Default value is F<transforms.trf>.


=item B<shakiness>

Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is
scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.


=item B<mincontrast>

Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is
discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default
value is 0.3.


=item B<tripod>

Set reference frame number for tripod mode.

If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame
in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea
is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep
the camera view absolutely still.

If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.


=item B<show>

Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an
integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any
visualization.

camera movements. Default value is 10.

For example a number of 10 means that 21 frames are used (10 in the
past and 10 in the future) to smoothen the motion in the video. A
larger value leads to a smoother video, but limits the acceleration of
the camera (pan/tilt movements). 0 is a special case where a static

=back



=head3 Commands


This filter supports the all above options as B<commands>.


=head2 vif


Obtain the average VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) between two input videos.

This filter takes two input videos.

Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained average VIF score is printed through the logging system.

The filter stores the calculated VIF score of each frame.

In the below example the input file F<main.mpg> being processed is compared
with the reference file F<ref.mpg>.

	
	ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi vif -f null -




=head2 vignette


Make or reverse a natural vignetting effect.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4

Available modes are:

=over 4


=item B<forward>

The larger the distance from the central point, the darker the image becomes.


=item B<backward>

The larger the distance from the central point, the brighter the image becomes.
This can be used to reverse a vignette effect, though there is no automatic
detection to extract the lens B<angle> and other settings (yet). It can
also be used to create a burning effect.

=back


Default value is B<forward>.


=item B<eval>

Set evaluation mode for the expressions (B<angle>, B<x0>, B<y0>).

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<init>

Evaluate expressions only once during the filter initialization.


=item B<frame>

B<init> mode since it requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it
allows advanced dynamic expressions.

=back


Default value is B<init>.


=item B<dither>

Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is C<1>
(enabled).


=item B<aspect>

Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette.
Setting this value to the SAR of the input will make a rectangular vignetting
following the dimensions of the video.

=head2 w3fdif


Deinterlace the input video ("w3fdif" stands for "Weston 3 Field
Deinterlacing Filter").

Based on the process described by Martin Weston for BBC R&D, and
implemented based on the de-interlace algorithm written by Jim
Easterbrook for BBC R&D, the Weston 3 field deinterlacing filter
uses filter coefficients calculated by BBC R&D.

This filter uses field-dominance information in frame to decide which
of each pair of fields to place first in the output.
If it gets it wrong use B<setfield> filter before C<w3fdif> filter.

There are two sets of filter coefficients, so called "simple"
and "complex". Which set of filter coefficients is used can
be set by passing an optional parameter:


=over 4


=item B<filter>

Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<simple>

Simple filter coefficient set.

=item B<complex>

More-complex filter coefficient set.

=back

Default value is B<complex>.


=item B<mode>

=over 4


=item B<frame>

Output one frame for each frame.

=item B<field>

Output one frame for each field.

=back


The default value is C<field>.


=item B<parity>

of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<tff>

Assume the top field is first.

=item B<bff>

Assume the bottom field is first.

=item B<auto>

Enable automatic detection of field parity.

=back


The default value is C<auto>.
If the interlacing is unknown or the decoder does not export this information,
top field first will be assumed.


=item B<deint>

Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<all>

Deinterlace all frames,

=item B<interlaced>

Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

=back


Default value is B<all>.

=back



=head3 Commands

This filter supports same B<commands> as options.


=head2 waveform

Video waveform monitor.

The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By default luminance
only. Each column of the waveform corresponds to a column of pixels in the
source video.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode, m>

Can be either C<row>, or C<column>. Default is C<column>.
In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color component value 0 and
the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top side represents
color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.


=item B<intensity, i>

Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how many values of the same
luminance are distributed across input rows/columns.
Default value is C<0.04>. Allowed range is [0, 1].


=item B<mirror, r>

Set mirroring mode. C<0> means unmirrored, C<1> means mirrored.
In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left
side for C<row> mode and at the top for C<column> mode. Default is
C<1> (mirrored).


=item B<display, d>

Set display mode.
It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<overlay>

Presents information identical to that in the C<parade>, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences or similarities
in overlapping areas of the color components that are supposed to be identical,
such as neutral whites, grays, or blacks.


=item B<stack>

Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
C<row> mode or one below the other in C<column> mode.


=item B<parade>

Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
C<column> mode or one below the other in C<row> mode.

Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights
and shadows of an image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom
graphs of each waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized
by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the picture
should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the
correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms.

=back

Default is C<stack>.


=item B<components, c>

Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which means only luminance
or red color component if input is in RGB colorspace. If is set for example to
7 it will display all 3 (if) available color components.

=item B<inputs>

Set number of input streams. Default is 2.


=item B<layout>

Specify layout of inputs.
This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the user.
This sets position of each video input in output. Each input
is separated by '|'.

Numbers start at 0 and are separated by '_'. Optionally one can use wX and hX,
where X is video input from which to take width or height.
Multiple values can be used when separated by '+'. In such
case values are summed together.

Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of
the output video frame will be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each
other if their position doesn't leave enough space for the full frame of
adjoining videos.

For 2 inputs, a default layout of C<0_0|w0_0> is set. In all other cases,
a layout must be set by the user.

=head2 zscale

Scale (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library:
E<lt>B<https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg>E<gt>. To enable compilation of this
filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-libzimg>.

The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
as the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

If the input image format is different from the format requested by
the next filter, the zscale filter will convert the input to the
requested format.


=head3 Options

The filter accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input
dimension.

If the I<width> or I<w> value is 0, the input width is used for
the output. If the I<height> or I<h> value is 0, the input height
is used for the output.

If one and only one of the values is -n with n E<gt>= 1, the zscale filter
will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image,
calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will,
however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and
adjust the value if necessary.

If both values are -n with n E<gt>= 1, the behavior will be identical to
both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.

See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension
expression.

=head1 OPENCL VIDEO FILTERS


Below is a description of the currently available OpenCL video filters.

To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-opencl>.

Running OpenCL filters requires you to initialize a hardware device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter graph.

=over 4



=item B<-init_hw_device opencl[=>I<name>B<][:>I<device>B<[,>I<key=value>B<...]]>

Initialise a new hardware device of type I<opencl> called I<name>, using the
given device parameters.


=item B<-filter_hw_device> I<name>

Pass the hardware device called I<name> to all filters in any filter graph.


=back


For more detailed information see E<lt>B<https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options>E<gt>


=over 4


=item *

Example of choosing the first device on the second platform and running avgblur_opencl filter with default parameters on it.
	
	-init_hw_device opencl=gpu:1.0 -filter_hw_device gpu -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl, hwdownload" OUTPUT


=back


Since OpenCL filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded(B<hwupload>) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded(B<hwdownload>) back to normal memory. Note that B<hwupload> will upload to a surface with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a B<format> filter immediately before to get the input into the right format and B<hwdownload> does not support all formats on the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional B<format> filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.


=head2 avgblur_opencl


Apply average blur filter.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sizeX>

Set horizontal radius size.
Range is C<[1, 1024]> and default value is C<1>.


=item B<planes>

Set which planes to filter. Default value is C<0xf>, by which all planes are processed.


=item B<sizeY>

Set vertical radius size. Range is C<[1, 1024]> and default value is C<0>. If zero, C<sizeX> value will be used.

=back



=head3 Example



=over 4


=item *

Apply average blur filter with horizontal and vertical size of 3, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of the 7x7 region centered on it in the input. For pixels on the edges of the image, the region does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.
	
	-i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl=3, hwdownload" OUTPUT


=back



=head2 boxblur_opencl


Apply a boxblur algorithm to the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<luma_radius, lr>


=item B<luma_power, lp>


=item B<chroma_radius, cr>


=item B<chroma_power, cp>


=item B<alpha_radius, ar>


=item B<alpha_power, ap>



=back


A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<luma_radius, lr>


=item B<chroma_radius, cr>


=item B<alpha_radius, ar>

Set an expression for the box radius in pixels used for blurring the
corresponding input plane.

The radius value must be a non-negative number, and must not be
greater than the value of the expression C<min(w,h)/2> for the
luma and alpha planes, and of C<min(cw,ch)/2> for the chroma
planes.

Default value for B<luma_radius> is "2". If not specified,
B<chroma_radius> and B<alpha_radius> default to the
corresponding value set for B<luma_radius>.

The expressions can contain the following constants:

=over 4


=item B<w>


=item B<h>

The input width and height in pixels.


=item B<cw>


=item B<ch>

The input chroma image width and height in pixels.


=item B<hsub>


=item B<vsub>

The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the
pixel format "yuv422p", I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.

=back



=item B<luma_power, lp>


=item B<chroma_power, cp>


=item B<alpha_power, ap>

Specify how many times the boxblur filter is applied to the
corresponding plane.

Default value for B<luma_power> is 2. If not specified,
B<chroma_power> and B<alpha_power> default to the
corresponding value set for B<luma_power>.

A value of 0 will disable the effect.

=back



=head3 Examples


Apply boxblur filter, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of box-radiuses I<luma_radius>, I<chroma_radius>, I<alpha_radius> for each plane respectively. The filter will apply I<luma_power>, I<chroma_power>, I<alpha_power> times onto the corresponding plane. For pixels on the edges of the image, the radius does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.


=over 4


=item *

Apply a boxblur filter with the luma, chroma, and alpha radius
set to 2 and luma, chroma, and alpha power set to 3. The filter will run 3 times with box-radius set to 2 for every plane of the image.
	
	-i INPUT -vf "hwupload, boxblur_opencl=luma_radius=2:luma_power=3, hwdownload" OUTPUT
	-i INPUT -vf "hwupload, boxblur_opencl=2:3, hwdownload" OUTPUT



=item *

Whether or not feature points should be refined at a sub-pixel level.

This can be turned off for a slight performance gain at the cost of precision.

Defaults to C<1>.


=item B<smooth_strength>

The strength of the smoothing applied to the camera path from C<0.0> to C<1.0>.

C<1.0> is the maximum smoothing strength while values less than that result in less smoothing.

Defaults to C<0.0>.


=item B<smooth_window_multiplier>

Controls the size of the smoothing window (the number of frames buffered to determine motion information from).

The size of the smoothing window is determined by multiplying the framerate of the video by this number.

Acceptable values range from C<0.1> to C<10.0>.

Larger values increase the amount of motion data available for determining how to smooth the camera path,
potentially improving smoothness, but also increase latency and memory usage.

Defaults to C<2.0>.

=head2 program_opencl


Filter video using an OpenCL program.


=over 4



=item B<source>

OpenCL program source file.


=item B<kernel>

Kernel name in program.


=item B<inputs>

Number of inputs to the filter.  Defaults to 1.


=item B<size, s>

Size of output frames.  Defaults to the same as the first input.


=back


The C<program_opencl> filter also supports the B<framesync> options.

The program source file must contain a kernel function with the given name,
which will be run once for each plane of the output.  Each run on a plane
gets enqueued as a separate 2D global NDRange with one work-item for each
pixel to be generated.  The global ID offset for each work-item is therefore
the coordinates of a pixel in the destination image.

The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:

=over 4


=item *

Destination image, I<__write_only image2d_t>.

This image will become the output; the kernel should write all of it.

=item *

Frame index, I<unsigned int>.

This is a counter starting from zero and increasing by one for each frame.

=item *

Source images, I<__read_only image2d_t>.

These are the most recent images on each input.  The kernel may read from
them to generate the output, but they can't be written to.

=back


Example programs:


=over 4


=item *

Copy the input to the output (output must be the same size as the input).
	
	__kernel void copy(__write_only image2d_t destination,
	                   unsigned int index,
	                   __read_only  image2d_t source)

	    int2 location = (int2)(get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1));
	
	    float4 value = read_imagef(source, sampler, location);
	
	    write_imagef(destination, location, value);
	}



=item *

Apply a simple transformation, rotating the input by an amount increasing
with the index counter.  Pixel values are linearly interpolated by the
sampler, and the output need not have the same dimensions as the input.
	
	__kernel void rotate_image(__write_only image2d_t dst,
	                           unsigned int index,

	    float2 dst_pos = convert_float2(dst_loc) - dst_cen;
	    float2 src_pos = {
	        cos(angle) * dst_pos.x - sin(angle) * dst_pos.y,
	        sin(angle) * dst_pos.x + cos(angle) * dst_pos.y
	    };
	    src_pos = src_pos * src_dim / dst_dim;
	
	    float2 src_loc = src_pos + src_cen;
	
	    if (src_loc.x < 0.0f      || src_loc.y < 0.0f ||
	        src_loc.x > src_dim.x || src_loc.y > src_dim.y)
	        write_imagef(dst, dst_loc, 0.5f);
	    else
	        write_imagef(dst, dst_loc, read_imagef(src, sampler, src_loc));
	}



=item *

Blend two inputs together, with the amount of each input used varying
with the index counter.
	
	__kernel void blend_images(__write_only image2d_t dst,
	                           unsigned int index,
	                           __read_only  image2d_t src1,

=item B<param>

Tune the tone mapping algorithm. same as param option in B<tonemap>.


=item B<desat>

Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The
higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This
setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
(smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural,
at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

The default value is 0.5, and the algorithm here is a little different from
the cpu version tonemap currently. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.


=item B<threshold>

The tonemapping algorithm parameters is fine-tuned per each scene. And a threshold
is used to detect whether the scene has changed or not. If the distance between
the current frame average brightness and the current running average exceeds
a threshold value, we would re-calculate scene average and peak brightness.

=head1 VAAPI VIDEO FILTERS


VAAPI Video filters are usually used with VAAPI decoder and VAAPI encoder. Below is a description of VAAPI video filters.

To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-vaapi>.

To use vaapi filters, you need to setup the vaapi device correctly. For more information, please read E<lt>B<https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI>E<gt>

=head1 VIDEO SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available video sources.


=head2 buffer


Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in F<libavfilter/buffersrc.h>.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<video_size>

Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the
syntax of this option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.


=item B<width>

The input video width.


=item B<height>

The input video height.


=item B<pix_fmt>

A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
name.


=item B<time_base>

Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.


=item B<frame_rate>

Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.


=item B<pixel_aspect, sar>

The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.


=item B<sws_param>

This option is deprecated and ignored. Prepend C<sws_flags=I<flags>;>
to the filtergraph description to specify swscale flags for automatically
inserted scalers. See B<Filtergraph syntax>.


=item B<hw_frames_ctx>

When using a hardware pixel format, this should be a reference to an
AVHWFramesContext describing input frames.

=back


For example:
	
	buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1


will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format "yuv410p", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name "yuv410p" corresponds to the number 6
(check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in F<libavutil/pixfmt.h>),
this example corresponds to:
	
	buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1


Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this
syntax is deprecated:

I<width>:I<height>:I<pix_fmt>:I<time_base.num>:I<time_base.den>:I<pixel_aspect.num>:I<pixel_aspect.den>


=head2 cellauto


Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the
B<filename> and B<pattern> options. If such options are
not specified an initial state is created randomly.

At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of
the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole
frame is filled is defined by the B<scroll> option.

This source accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from
the specified file.
In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive
cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
file will be ignored.


=item B<pattern, p>

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from
the specified string.

Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive
cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
string will be ignored.


=item B<rate, r>

Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.


=item B<random_fill_ratio, ratio>

Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row. It
is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to
1/PHI.

This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.


=item B<random_seed, seed>

Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.


=item B<rule>

Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to 255.
Default value is 110.


=item B<size, s>

Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.

If B<filename> or B<pattern> is specified, the size is set
by default to the width of the specified initial state row, and the
height is set to I<width> * PHI.

If B<size> is set, it must contain the width of the specified
pattern string, and the specified pattern will be centered in the
larger row.

If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value
defaults to "320x518" (used for a randomly generated initial state).


=item B<scroll>

If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the output
have been already filled. If set to 0, the new generated row will be
written over the top row just after the bottom row is filled.
Defaults to 1.


=item B<start_full, full>

If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before
outputting the first frame.
This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.


=item B<stitch>

If set to 1, stitch the left and right row edges together.
This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Read the initial state from F<pattern>, and specify an output of
size 200x400.

=head2 life


Generate a life pattern.

This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.

The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The B<rule> option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.

This source accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.

If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.


=item B<rate, r>

Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.


=item B<random_fill_ratio, ratio>

Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.


=item B<random_seed, seed>

Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.


=item B<rule>

Set the life rule.

A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "SI<NS>/BI<NB>",
where I<NS> and I<NB> are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8,
I<NS> specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and I<NB> the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born").
"s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B", respectively.

Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = C<(12E<lt>E<lt>9)+9> specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".

Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway's game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.


=item B<size, s>

Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.

If B<filename> is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If B<size> is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.

If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x240"
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).


=item B<stitch>

If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.


=item B<mold>

Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from B<death_color> to
B<mold_color> with a step of B<mold>. B<mold> can have a
value from 0 to 255.


=item B<life_color>

Set the color of living (or new born) cells.


=item B<death_color>

Set the color of dead cells. If B<mold> is set, this is the first color
used to represent a dead cell.


=item B<mold_color>

Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the B<"Color" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual>.

The C<allrgb> source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of all rgb colors.

The C<allyuv> source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of all yuv colors.

The C<color> source provides an uniformly colored input.

The C<haldclutsrc> source provides an identity Hald CLUT. See also
B<haldclut> filter.

The C<nullsrc> source returns unprocessed video frames. It is
mainly useful to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as the
source for filters which ignore the input data.

The C<pal75bars> source generates a color bars pattern, based on
EBU PAL recommendations with 75% color levels.

The C<pal100bars> source generates a color bars pattern, based on
EBU PAL recommendations with 100% color levels.

The C<rgbtestsrc> source generates an RGB test pattern useful for
detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You should see a red, green and blue
stripe from top to bottom.

The C<smptebars> source generates a color bars pattern, based on
the SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.

The C<smptehdbars> source generates a color bars pattern, based on

There are I<n>x(I<v>+I<a>) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.

Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.

For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.

All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the
filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video
streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for
audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
explicitly by the user.

Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate
at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual version
(video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2):
	
	ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
	  '[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
	   concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]' \
	  -map '[v]' -map '[a1]' -map '[a2]' output.mkv



=item *

Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using the
(a)movie sources, and adjusting the resolution:
	
	movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
	movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
	[v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]

Note that a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video streams
do not have exactly the same duration in the first file.

=head2 ebur128


EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream and analyzes its loudness
level. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of 10Hz with the
Momentary loudness (identified by C<M>), Short-term loudness (C<S>),
Integrated loudness (C<I>) and Loudness Range (C<LRA>).

The filter can only analyze streams which have a sampling rate of 48000 Hz and whose
sample format is double-precision floating point. The input stream will be converted to
this specification, if needed. Users may need to insert aformat and/or aresample filters
after this filter to obtain the original parameters.

The filter also has a video output (see the I<video> option) with a real
time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged
message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the
short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for
the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured
to instead display short-term loudness (see I<gauge>).

The green area marks a  +/- 1LU target range around the target loudness
(-23LUFS by default, unless modified through I<target>).

More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on
E<lt>B<http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness>E<gt>.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<video>

Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged whether this
option is set or no. The video stream will be the first output stream if
activated. Default is C<0>.


=item B<size>

Set the video size. This option is for video only. For the syntax of this
option, check the
B<"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual>.
Default and minimum resolution is C<640x480>.


=item B<meter>

Set the EBU scale meter. Default is C<9>. Common values are C<9> and
C<18>, respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any
other integer value between this range is allowed.


=item B<metadata>

Set metadata injection. If set to C<1>, the audio input will be segmented
into 100ms output frames, each of them containing various loudness information
in metadata.  All the metadata keys are prefixed with C<lavfi.r128.>.

Default is C<0>.


=item B<framelog>

Force the frame logging level.

Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<info>

information logging level

=item B<verbose>

verbose logging level

=back


By default, the logging level is set to I<info>. If the B<video> or
the B<metadata> options are set, it switches to I<verbose>.


=item B<peak>

Set peak mode(s).

Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a C<flag> type). Possible
values are:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Disable any peak mode (default).

=item B<sample>

Enable sample-peak mode.

Simple peak mode looking for the higher sample value. It logs a message
for sample-peak (identified by C<SPK>).

=item B<true>

Enable true-peak mode.

If enabled, the peak lookup is done on an over-sampled version of the input
stream for better peak accuracy. It logs a message for true-peak.
(identified by C<TPK>) and true-peak per frame (identified by C<FTPK>).
This mode requires a build with C<libswresample>.

=back



=item B<dualmono>

Treat mono input files as "dual mono". If a mono file is intended for playback
on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect.
If set to C<true>, this option will compensate for this effect.
Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.


=item B<panlaw>

Set a specific pan law to be used for the measurement of dual mono files.
This parameter is optional, and has a default value of -3.01dB.


=item B<target>

Set a specific target level (in LUFS) used as relative zero in the visualization.
This parameter is optional and has a default value of -23LUFS as specified
by EBU R128. However, material published online may prefer a level of -16LUFS
(e.g. for use with podcasts or video platforms).


=item B<gauge>

Set the value displayed by the gauge. Valid values are C<momentary> and s
C<shortterm>. By default the momentary value will be used, but in certain
scenarios it may be more useful to observe the short term value instead (e.g.
live mixing).


=item B<scale>

Sets the display scale for the loudness. Valid parameters are C<absolute>
(in LUFS) or C<relative> (LU) relative to the target. This only affects the
video output, not the summary or continuous log output.

=back



=head2 interleave, ainterleave


Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

C<interleave> works with video inputs, C<ainterleave> with audio.

These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.

Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.

In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.

For example consider the case when one input is a C<select> filter
which always drops input frames. The C<interleave> filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.

Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

These filters accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<nb_inputs, n>

Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.


=item B<duration>

How to determine the end-of-stream.


=over 4


=item B<longest>

The duration of the longest input. (default)


=item B<shortest>

The duration of the shortest input.


=item B<first>

The duration of the first input.

Can be one of following:


=over 4


=item B<same_str>

Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value is same as C<value>.


=item B<starts_with>

Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value starts with
the C<value> option string.

=head2 perms, aperms


Set read/write permissions for the output frames.

These filters are mainly aimed at developers to test direct path in the
following filter in the filtergraph.

The filters accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode>

Select the permissions mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do nothing. This is the default.

=item B<ro>

Set all the output frames read-only.

=item B<rw>

Set all the output frames directly writable.

=item B<toggle>

Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if read-only.

=item B<random>

Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.

=back



=item B<seed>

Set the seed for the I<random> mode, must be an integer included between
C<0> and C<UINT32_MAX>. If not specified, or if explicitly set to
C<-1>, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort
basis.

=back


Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission filter and the
following one, the permission might not be received as expected in that
following filter. Inserting a B<format> or B<aformat> filter before the
perms/aperms filter can avoid this problem.


=head2 realtime, arealtime


Slow down filtering to match real time approximately.

These filters will pause the filtering for a variable amount of time to
match the output rate with the input timestamps.
They are similar to the B<re> option to C<ffmpeg>.

They accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<limit>

Time limit for the pauses. Any pause longer than that will be considered
a timestamp discontinuity and reset the timer. Default is 2 seconds.

=item B<speed>

Speed factor for processing. The value must be a float larger than zero.
Values larger than 1.0 will result in faster than realtime processing,
smaller will slow processing down. The I<limit> is automatically adapted
accordingly. Default is 1.0.

A processing speed faster than what is possible without these filters cannot
be achieved.

=back




=head2 select, aselect


Select frames to pass in output.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<expr, e>

Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame.

If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded.

If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the
first output; otherwise it is sent to the output with index
C<ceil(val)-1>, assuming that the input index starts from 0.

For example a value of C<1.2> corresponds to the output with index
C<ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1>, that is the second output.


=item B<outputs, n>

Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected
frame is based on the result of the evaluation. Default value is 1.

=back


The expression can contain the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<n>

The (sequential) number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.


=item B<selected_n>

The (sequential) number of the selected frame, starting from 0.


=item B<prev_selected_n>

expressed in seconds. It's NAN if undefined.


=item B<prev_pts>

The PTS of the previously filtered video frame. It's NAN if undefined.


=item B<prev_selected_pts>

The PTS of the last previously filtered video frame. It's NAN if undefined.


=item B<prev_selected_t>

The PTS of the last previously selected video frame, expressed in seconds. It's NAN if undefined.


=item B<start_pts>

The PTS of the first video frame in the video. It's NAN if undefined.


=item B<start_t>

The time of the first video frame in the video. It's NAN if undefined.


=item B<pict_type> I<(video only)>

The type of the filtered frame. It can assume one of the following
values:

=over 4


=item B<I>


=item B<P>


=item B<B>


=item B<S>


=item B<SI>


=item B<SP>


=item B<BI>


=back



=item B<interlace_type> I<(video only)>

The frame interlace type. It can assume one of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<PROGRESSIVE>

The frame is progressive (not interlaced).

=item B<TOPFIRST>

The frame is top-field-first.

=item B<BOTTOMFIRST>

The frame is bottom-field-first.

=back



=item B<consumed_sample_n> I<(audio only)>

the number of selected samples before the current frame


=item B<samples_n> I<(audio only)>

the number of samples in the current frame


=item B<sample_rate> I<(audio only)>

the input sample rate


=item B<key>

This is 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise.


=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the information
is not available (e.g. for synthetic video)


=item B<scene> I<(video only)>

value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low
probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher
value means the current frame is more likely to be one (see the example below)


=item B<concatdec_select>

The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input file by setting an
inpoint and an outpoint, but the output packets may not be entirely contained
in the selected interval. By using this variable, it is possible to skip frames
generated by the concat demuxer which are not exactly contained in the selected
interval.

This works by comparing the frame pts against the I<lavf.concat.start_time>
and the I<lavf.concat.duration> packet metadata values which are also
present in the decoded frames.

The I<concatdec_select> variable is -1 if the frame pts is at least
start_time and either the duration metadata is missing or the frame pts is less
than start_time + duration, 0 otherwise, and NaN if the start_time metadata is
missing.

That basically means that an input frame is selected if its pts is within the
interval set by the concat demuxer.


=back


The default value of the select expression is "1".


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Select all frames in input:

Select frames with a minimum distance of 10 seconds:
	
	select='isnan(prev_selected_t)+gte(t-prev_selected_t\,10)'

=item *

Create a mosaic of the first scenes:
	
	ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf select='gt(scene\,0.4)',scale=160:120,tile -frames:v 1 preview.png


Comparing I<scene> against a value between 0.3 and 0.5 is generally a sane
choice.


=item *

Send even and odd frames to separate outputs, and compose them:
	
	select=n=2:e='mod(n, 2)+1' [odd][even]; [odd] pad=h=2*ih [tmp]; [tmp][even] overlay=y=h

=head2 sendcmd, asendcmd


Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.

These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the
filtergraph.

C<sendcmd> must be inserted between two video filters,
C<asendcmd> must be inserted between two audio filters, but apart
from that they act the same way.

The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments
with the I<commands> option, or in a file specified by the
I<filename> option.

These filters accept the following options:

Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

=item B<filename, f>

Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other

=head3 Commands syntax


A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
interval.

An interval is specified by the following syntax:
	
	<START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>;


The time interval is specified by the I<START> and I<END> times.
I<END> is optional and defaults to the maximum time.

The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
it is included in the interval [I<START>, I<END>), that is when
the time is greater or equal to I<START> and is lesser than
I<END>.

I<COMMANDS> consists of a sequence of one or more command
specifications, separated by ",", relating to that interval.  The
syntax of a command specification is given by:
	
	[<FLAGS>] <TARGET> <COMMAND> <ARG>


I<FLAGS> is optional and specifies the type of events relating to
the time interval which enable sending the specified command, and must
be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by "+" or "|" and
enclosed between "[" and "]".

The following flags are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<enter>

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
current is.


=item B<leave>

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the
current is not.


=item B<expr>

The command I<ARG> is interpreted as expression and result of
expression is passed as I<ARG>.

The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following
constants:


=over 4


=item B<POS>

Original position in the file of the frame, or undefined if undefined
for the current frame.


=item B<PTS>

The presentation timestamp in input.


=item B<N>

The count of the input frame for video or audio, starting from 0.


=item B<T>

The time in seconds of the current frame.


=item B<TS>

The start time in seconds of the current command interval.


=item B<TE>

The end time in seconds of the current command interval.


=item B<TI>

The interpolated time of the current command interval, TI = (T - TS) / (TE - TS).

=back



=back


If I<FLAGS> is not specified, a default value of C<[enter]> is
assumed.

I<TARGET> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.

I<COMMAND> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

I<ARG> is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for
the given I<COMMAND>.

Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or
sequences of characters starting with C<#> until the end of line,
are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.

A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax
follows:
	
	<COMMAND_FLAG>  ::= "enter" | "leave"
	<COMMAND_FLAGS> ::= <COMMAND_FLAG> [(+|"|")<COMMAND_FLAG>]
	<COMMAND>       ::= ["[" <COMMAND_FLAGS> "]"] <TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]
	<COMMANDS>      ::= <COMMAND> [,<COMMANDS>]
	<INTERVAL>      ::= <START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>
	<INTERVALS>     ::= <INTERVAL>[;<INTERVALS>]

=head2 setrange


Force color range for the output video frame.

The C<setrange> filter marks the color range property for the
output frames. It does not change the input frame, but only sets the
corresponding property, which affects how the frame is treated by
following filters.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4

=back



=head2 spectrumsynth


Synthesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents
magnitude across time and second represents phase across time.
The filter will transform from frequency domain as displayed in videos back
to time domain as presented in audio output.

This filter is primarily created for reversing processed B<showspectrum>
filter outputs, but can synthesize sound from other spectrograms too.
But in such case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not
available, because in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually
it's just recreated from random noise.
For best results use gray only output (C<channel> color mode in
B<showspectrum> filter) and C<log> scale for magnitude video and
C<lin> scale for phase video. To produce phase, for 2nd video, use
C<data> option. Inputs videos should generally use C<fullframe>
slide mode as that saves resources needed for decoding video.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sample_rate>

Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which
spectrum was generated may differ.


=item B<channels>

Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.

which means optimal overlap for selected window function will be picked.


=item B<orientation>

Set orientation of input videos. Can be C<vertical> or C<horizontal>.
Default is C<vertical>.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

First create magnitude and phase videos from audio, assuming audio is stereo with 44100 sample rate,

	ffmpeg -i input.flac -lavfi showspectrum=mode=separate:scale=lin:overlap=0.875:color=channel:slide=fullframe:data=phase -an -c:v rawvideo phase.nut
	ffmpeg -i magnitude.nut -i phase.nut -lavfi spectrumsynth=channels=2:sample_rate=44100:win_func=hann:overlap=0.875:slide=fullframe output.flac


=back



=head2 split, asplit


Split input into several identical outputs.

C<asplit> works with audio input, C<split> with video.

The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of outputs. If
unspecified, it defaults to 2.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Create two separate outputs from the same input:
	
	[in] split [out0][out1]



=item *

To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of
outputs, like in:
	
	[in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]



=item *

Create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and
one padded:
	
	[in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
	[splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
	[splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];



=item *

Create 5 copies of the input audio with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT


=back



=head2 zmq, azmq


Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to
filters in the filtergraph.

C<zmq> and C<azmq> work as a pass-through filters. C<zmq>
must be inserted between two video filters, C<azmq> between two
audio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any filter type.

To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and
headers and configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-libzmq>.

For more information about libzmq see:
E<lt>B<http://www.zeromq.org/>E<gt>

The C<zmq> and C<azmq> filters work as a libzmq server, which
receives messages sent through a network interface defined by the
B<bind_address> (or the abbreviation "B<b>") option.
Default value of this option is F<tcp://localhost:5555>. You may
want to alter this value to your needs, but do not forget to escape any
':' signs (see B<filtergraph escaping>).

The received message must be in the form:
	
	<TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]


I<TARGET> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name. The default
filter instance name uses the pattern B<Parsed_E<lt>filter_nameE<gt>_E<lt>indexE<gt>>,
but you can override this by using the B<filter_name@id> syntax
(see B<Filtergraph syntax>).

I<COMMAND> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

I<ARG> is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the
given I<COMMAND>.

Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command
is injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter
will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:
	
	<ERROR_CODE> <ERROR_REASON>
	<MESSAGE>


I<MESSAGE> is optional.


=head3 Examples


Look at F<tools/zmqsend> for an example of a zmq client which can
be used to send commands processed by these filters.

Consider the following filtergraph generated by B<ffplay>.
In this example the last overlay filter has an instance name. All other
filters will have default instance names.

	
	ffplay -dumpgraph 1 -f lavfi "
	color=s=100x100:c=red  [l];
	color=s=100x100:c=blue [r];
	nullsrc=s=200x100, zmq [bg];
	[bg][l]   overlay     [bg+l];
	[bg+l][r] overlay@my=x=100 "


To change the color of the left side of the video, the following
command can be used:
	
	echo Parsed_color_0 c yellow | tools/zmqsend


To change the right side:
	
	echo Parsed_color_1 c pink | tools/zmqsend


To change the position of the right side:
	
	echo overlay@my x 150 | tools/zmqsend





=head1 MULTIMEDIA SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.


=head2 amovie


This is the same as B<movie> source, except it selects an audio
stream by default.



=head2 movie


Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<filename>

The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a
device or a stream accessed through some protocol).


=item B<format_name, f>

Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the
format is guessed from I<movie_name> or by probing.


=item B<seek_point, sp>

Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output
starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with
C<av_strtod>, so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS
postfix. The default value is "0".


=item B<streams, s>

Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
separated by "+". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
same order. The syntax is explained in the B<"Stream specifiers"
section in the ffmpeg manual>. Two special names, "dv" and "da" specify
respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default
is "dv", or "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".


=item B<stream_index, si>

Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1,
the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default
value is "-1". Deprecated. If the filter is called "amovie", it will select
audio instead of video.


=item B<loop>

Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.
If the value is 0, the stream will be looped infinitely.
Default value is "1".

Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.


=item B<discontinuity>

Specifies the time difference between frames above which the point is
considered a timestamp discontinuity which is removed by adjusting the later
timestamps.

=back


It allows overlaying a second video on top of the main input of
a filtergraph, as shown in this graph:
	
	input -----------> deltapts0 --> overlay --> output
	                                    ^
	                                    |
	movie --> scale--> deltapts1 -------+

	[in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
	[main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]



=item *

Read the first video stream and the audio stream with id 0x81 from
dvd.vob; the video is connected to the pad named "video" and the audio is
connected to the pad named "audio":
	
	movie=dvd.vob:s=v:0+#0x81 [video] [audio]


=back



=head3 Commands


Both movie and amovie support the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<seek>

Perform seek using "av_seek_frame".
The syntax is: seek I<stream_index>|I<timestamp>|I<flags>

=over 4


=item *

I<stream_index>: If stream_index is -1, a default
stream is selected, and I<timestamp> is automatically converted
from AV_TIME_BASE units to the stream specific time_base.

=item *

I<timestamp>: Timestamp in AVStream.time_base units
or, if no stream is specified, in AV_TIME_BASE units.

=item *

I<flags>: Flags which select direction and seeking mode.

=back



=item B<get_duration>

Get movie duration in AV_TIME_BASE units.


=back



=head1 EXTERNAL LIBRARIES


FFmpeg can be hooked up with a number of external libraries to add support
for more formats. None of them are used by default, their use has to be
explicitly requested by passing the appropriate flags to
B<./configure>.


=head2 Alliance for Open Media (AOM)


FFmpeg can make use of the AOM library for AV1 decoding and encoding.

Go to E<lt>B<http://aomedia.org/>E<gt> and follow the instructions for
installing the library. Then pass C<--enable-libaom> to configure to
enable it.


=head2 AMD AMF/VCE


FFmpeg can use the AMD Advanced Media Framework library
for accelerated H.264 and HEVC(only windows) encoding on hardware with Video Coding Engine (VCE).

To enable support you must obtain the AMF framework header files(version 1.4.9+) from
E<lt>B<https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF.git>E<gt>.

Create an C<AMF/> directory in the system include path.
Copy the contents of C<AMF/amf/public/include/> into that directory.
Then configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-amf>.

Initialization of amf encoder occurs in this order:
1) trying to initialize through dx11(only windows)
2) trying to initialize through dx9(only windows)
3) trying to initialize through vulkan

To use h.264(AMD VCE) encoder on linux amdgru-pro version 19.20+ and amf-amdgpu-pro
package(amdgru-pro contains, but does not install automatically) are required.

This driver can be installed using amdgpu-pro-install script in official amd driver archive.


=head2 AviSynth


FFmpeg can read AviSynth scripts as input. To enable support, pass
C<--enable-avisynth> to configure after installing the headers
provided by E<lt>B<https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus>E<gt>.
AviSynth+ can be configured to install only the headers by either
passing C<-DHEADERS_ONLY:bool=on> to the normal CMake-based build
system, or by using the supplied C<GNUmakefile>.

For Windows, supported AviSynth variants are
E<lt>B<http://avisynth.nl>E<gt> for 32-bit builds and
E<lt>B<http://avisynth.nl/index.php/AviSynth+>E<gt> for 32-bit and 64-bit builds.

For Linux, macOS, and BSD, the only supported AviSynth variant is
E<lt>B<https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus>E<gt>, starting with version 3.5.


=over 4

In 2016, AviSynth+ added support for building with GCC. However, due to
the eccentricities of Windows' calling conventions, 32-bit GCC builds
of AviSynth+ are not compatible with typical 32-bit builds of FFmpeg.

By default, FFmpeg assumes compatibility with 32-bit MSVC builds of
AviSynth+ since that is the most widely-used and entrenched build
configuration.  Users can override this and enable support for 32-bit
GCC builds of AviSynth+ by passing C<-DAVSC_WIN32_GCC32> to
C<--extra-cflags> when configuring FFmpeg.

64-bit builds of FFmpeg are not affected, and can use either MSVC or
GCC builds of AviSynth+ without any special flags.

=back



=over 4

AviSynth(+) is loaded dynamically.  Distributors can build FFmpeg
with C<--enable-avisynth>, and the binaries will work regardless
of the end user having AviSynth installed.  If/when an end user
would like to use AviSynth scripts, then they can install AviSynth(+)
and FFmpeg will be able to find and use it to open scripts.

=back



=head2 Chromaprint


FFmpeg can make use of the Chromaprint library for generating audio fingerprints.
Pass C<--enable-chromaprint> to configure to
enable it. See E<lt>B<https://acoustid.org/chromaprint>E<gt>.


=head2 codec2


FFmpeg can make use of the codec2 library for codec2 decoding and encoding.
There is currently no native decoder, so libcodec2 must be used for decoding.

Go to E<lt>B<http://freedv.org/>E<gt>, download "Codec 2 source archive".
Build and install using CMake. Debian users can install the libcodec2-dev package instead.
Once libcodec2 is installed you can pass C<--enable-libcodec2> to configure to enable it.

The easiest way to use codec2 is with .c2 files, since they contain the mode information required for decoding.
To encode such a file, use a .c2 file extension and give the libcodec2 encoder the -mode option:
C<ffmpeg -i input.wav -mode 700C output.c2>.
Playback is as simple as C<ffplay output.c2>.
For a list of supported modes, run C<ffmpeg -h encoder=libcodec2>.
Raw codec2 files are also supported.
To make sense of them the mode in use needs to be specified as a format option:
C<ffmpeg -f codec2raw -mode 1300 -i input.raw output.wav>.


=head2 dav1d


FFmpeg can make use of the dav1d library for AV1 video decoding.

enable it.


=head2 OpenCORE, VisualOn, and Fraunhofer libraries


Spun off Google Android sources, OpenCore, VisualOn and Fraunhofer
libraries provide encoders for a number of audio codecs.


=over 4

OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License 2.0
(see E<lt>B<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>E<gt> for details), which is
incompatible to the LGPL version 2.1 and GPL version 2. You have to
upgrade FFmpeg's license to LGPL version 3 (or if you have enabled
GPL components, GPL version 3) by passing C<--enable-version3> to configure in
order to use it.

The license of the Fraunhofer AAC library is incompatible with the GPL.
Therefore, for GPL builds, you have to pass C<--enable-nonfree> to
configure in order to use it. To the best of our knowledge, it is
compatible with the LGPL.

=back



=head3 OpenCORE AMR


FFmpeg can make use of the OpenCORE libraries for AMR-NB
decoding/encoding and AMR-WB decoding.

Go to E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencore-amr/>E<gt> and follow the
instructions for installing the libraries.
Then pass C<--enable-libopencore-amrnb> and/or
C<--enable-libopencore-amrwb> to configure to enable them.

For decoding, this library is much more limited than the built-in decoder
in libavcodec; currently, this library lacks support for decoding B-frames
and some other main/high profile features. (It currently only supports
constrained baseline profile and CABAC.) Using it is mostly useful for
testing and for taking advantage of Cisco's patent portfolio license
(E<lt>B<http://www.openh264.org/BINARY_LICENSE.txt>E<gt>).


=head2 OpenJPEG


FFmpeg can use the OpenJPEG libraries for decoding/encoding J2K videos.  Go to
