=head1 NAME

ffmpeg-codecs - FFmpeg codecs

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This document describes the codecs (decoders and encoders) provided by
the libavcodec library.




=head1 CODEC OPTIONS


libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.

Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVCodecContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follow:


=over 4


=item B<b> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio,video>B<)>

Set bitrate in bits/s. Default value is 200K.


=item B<ab> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio>B<)>

Set audio bitrate (in bits/s). Default value is 128K.


=item B<bt> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,video>B<)>

Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode, bitrate
tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from the
target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max
bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on quality.


=item B<flags> I<flags> B<(>I<decoding/encoding,audio,video,subtitles>B<)>

Set generic flags.

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<mv4>

Use four motion vector by macroblock (mpeg4).

=item B<qpel>

Use 1/4 pel motion compensation.

=item B<loop>

Use loop filter.

=item B<qscale>

Use fixed qscale.

=item B<pass1>

Use internal 2pass ratecontrol in first pass mode.

=item B<pass2>

=item B<drop_changed>

Don't output frames whose parameters differ from first decoded frame in stream.
Error AVERROR_INPUT_CHANGED is returned when a frame is dropped.

Use interlaced DCT.

=item B<low_delay>

Force low delay.

=item B<global_header>

Place global headers in extradata instead of every keyframe.

=item B<bitexact>

Only write platform-, build- and time-independent data. (except (I)DCT).
This ensures that file and data checksums are reproducible and match between
platforms. Its primary use is for regression testing.

=item B<aic>

=item B<ilme>

Apply interlaced motion estimation.

=item B<cgop>

=back



=item B<time_base> I<rational number>

Set codec time base.

It is the fundamental unit of time (in seconds) in terms of which
frame timestamps are represented. For fixed-fps content, timebase
should be C<1 / frame_rate> and timestamp increments should be
identically 1.

Set audio frame size.

Each submitted frame except the last must contain exactly frame_size
samples per channel. May be 0 when the codec has
CODEC_CAP_VARIABLE_FRAME_SIZE set, in that case the frame size is not
restricted. It is set by some decoders to indicate constant frame
size.

Set the frame number.


=item B<delay> I<integer>



=item B<qcomp> I<float> B<(>I<encoding,video>B<)>

in the ratecontrol equation. Recommended range for default rc_eq:
0.0-1.0.

disabled. If a value of -1 is used, it will choose an automatic value
depending on the encoder.

Sets the display duration of the decoded teletext pages or subtitles in
milliseconds. Default value is -1 which means infinity or until the next
subtitle event comes.

=item B<txt_transparent>

Force transparent background of the generated teletext bitmaps. Default value
is 0 which means an opaque background.

=item B<txt_opacity>

Sets the opacity (0-255) of the teletext background. If
B<txt_transparent> is not set, it only affects characters between a start
box and an end box, typically subtitles. Default value is 0 if
B<txt_transparent> is set, 255 otherwise.

The option C<-encoders> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled encoders.



=head1 AUDIO ENCODERS


A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.



=head2 aac


Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoder.

This encoder is the default AAC encoder, natively implemented into FFmpeg.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<b>

Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode. If this option is unspecified it is set to 128kbps.


=item B<q>

Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the B<ffmpeg> command-line tool. For library interface users, use
B<global_quality>.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency. If unspecified will allow the encoder to dynamically
adjust the cutoff to improve clarity on low bitrates.


=item B<aac_coder>

Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<twoloop>

Two loop searching (TLS) method.

This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.  Will tune
itself based on whether B<aac_is>, B<aac_ms> and B<aac_pns>
are enabled.


=item B<anmr>

Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.

This is an experimental coder which currently produces a lower quality, is more
unstable and is slower than the default twoloop coder but has potential.
Currently has no support for the B<aac_is> or B<aac_pns> options.
Not currently recommended.


=item B<fast>

Constant quantizer method.

Uses a cheaper version of twoloop algorithm that doesn't try to do as many
clever adjustments. Worse with low bitrates (less than 64kbps), but is better
and much faster at higher bitrates.
This is the default choice for a coder


=back



=item B<aac_ms>

Sets mid/side coding mode. The default value of "auto" will automatically use
M/S with bands which will benefit from such coding. Can be forced for all bands
using the value "enable", which is mainly useful for debugging or disabled using
"disable".


=item B<aac_is>

Sets intensity stereo coding tool usage. By default, it's enabled and will
automatically toggle IS for similar pairs of stereo bands if it's beneficial.
Can be disabled for debugging by setting the value to "disable".


=item B<aac_pns>

Uses perceptual noise substitution to replace low entropy high frequency bands
with imperceptible white noise during the decoding process. By default, it's
enabled, but can be disabled for debugging purposes by using "disable".


=item B<aac_tns>

Enables the use of a multitap FIR filter which spans through the high frequency
bands to hide quantization noise during the encoding process and is reverted
by the decoder. As well as decreasing unpleasant artifacts in the high range
this also reduces the entropy in the high bands and allows for more bits to
be used by the mid-low bands. By default it's enabled but can be disabled for
debugging by setting the option to "disable".


=item B<aac_ltp>

Enables the use of the long term prediction extension which increases coding
efficiency in very low bandwidth situations such as encoding of voice or
solo piano music by extending constant harmonic peaks in bands throughout
frames. This option is implied by profile:a aac_low and is incompatible with
aac_pred. Use in conjunction with B<-ar> to decrease the samplerate.


=item B<aac_pred>

Enables the use of a more traditional style of prediction where the spectral
coefficients transmitted are replaced by the difference of the current
coefficients minus the previous "predicted" coefficients. In theory and sometimes
in practice this can improve quality for low to mid bitrate audio.
This option implies the aac_main profile and is incompatible with aac_ltp.


=item B<profile>

Sets the encoding profile, possible values:


=over 4


=item B<aac_low>

The default, AAC "Low-complexity" profile. Is the most compatible and produces
decent quality.


=item B<mpeg2_aac_low>

Equivalent to C<-profile:a aac_low -aac_pns 0>. PNS was introduced with the
MPEG4 specifications.


=item B<aac_ltp>

Long term prediction profile, is enabled by and will enable the B<aac_ltp>
option. Introduced in MPEG4.


=item B<aac_main>

Main-type prediction profile, is enabled by and will enable the B<aac_pred>
option. Introduced in MPEG2.


=back

If this option is unspecified it is set to B<aac_low>.

=back



=head2 ac3 and ac3_fixed


AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The I<ac3> encoder uses floating-point math, while the I<ac3_fixed>
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The I<ac3_fixed> encoder is not the default codec for
any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly using the option
C<-acodec ac3_fixed> in order to use it.


=head3 AC-3 Metadata


The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

=head4 Audio Production Information

Audio Production Information is optional information describing the mixing
environment.  Either none or both of the fields are written to the bitstream.


=over 4



=item B<-mixing_level> I<number>

Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the production
environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are 80 to 111, or -1 for
unknown or not indicated. The default value is -1, but that value cannot be
used if the Audio Production Information is written to the bitstream. Therefore,
if the C<room_type> option is not the default value, the C<mixing_level>
option must not be -1.


=item B<-room_type> I<type>

Room Type. Describes the equalization used during the final mixing session at
the studio or on the dubbing stage. A large room is a dubbing stage with the

=item B<-dialnorm> I<value>

Dialogue Normalization. Indicates how far the average dialogue level of the
program is below digital 100% full scale (0 dBFS). This parameter determines a
level shift during audio reproduction that sets the average volume of the
dialogue to a preset level. The goal is to match volume level between program
sources. A value of -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to
the source volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers in
the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.

=head3 Extended Bitstream Information

The extended bitstream options are part of the Alternate Bit Stream Syntax as
specified in Annex D of the A/52:2010 standard. It is grouped into 2 parts.
If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values in that group will be
written to the bitstream.  Default values are used for those that are written
but have not been specified.  If the mixing levels are written, the decoder
will use these values instead of the ones specified in the C<center_mixlev>
and C<surround_mixlev> options if it supports the Alternate Bit Stream
Syntax.

=item B<-stereo_rematrixing> I<boolean>

Stereo Rematrixing. Enables/Disables use of rematrixing for stereo input. This
is an optional AC-3 feature that increases quality by selectively encoding
the left/right channels as mid/side. This option is enabled by default, and it
is highly recommended that it be left as enabled except for testing purposes.

=head3 Floating-Point-Only AC-3 Encoding Options


These options are only valid for the floating-point encoder and do not exist
for the fixed-point encoder due to the corresponding features not being

=over 4



=item B<-channel_coupling> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3 feature
that increases quality by combining high frequency information from multiple
channels into a single channel. The per-channel high frequency information is
sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.

=head2 libfdk_aac


libfdk-aac AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder wrapper.

The libfdk-aac library is based on the Fraunhofer FDK AAC code from
the Android project.

Requires the presence of the libfdk-aac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libfdk-aac>. The library is also incompatible with GPL,
so if you allow the use of GPL, you should configure with
C<--enable-gpl --enable-nonfree --enable-libfdk-aac>.

This encoder has support for the AAC-HE profiles.

VBR encoding, enabled through the B<vbr> or B<flags
+qscale> options, is experimental and only works with some
combinations of parameters.

Support for encoding 7.1 audio is only available with libfdk-aac 0.1.3 or
higher.

For more information see the fdk-aac project at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/p/opencore-amr/fdk-aac/>E<gt>.

Use constrained variable bit rate encoding.

=back



=item B<compression_level (>I<comp>B<)>

Set encoding algorithm complexity. Valid options are integers in
the 0-10 range. 0 gives the fastest encodes but lower quality, while 10
gives the highest quality but slowest encoding. The default is 10.


=item B<frame_duration (>I<framesize>B<)>

Set maximum frame size, or duration of a frame in milliseconds. The
argument must be exactly the following: 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60. Smaller
frame sizes achieve lower latency but less quality at a given bitrate.
Sizes greater than 20ms are only interesting at fairly low bitrates.
The default is 20ms.


=item B<packet_loss (>I<expect-loss>B<)>

Set expected packet loss percentage. The default is 0.


=item B<fec (>I<n/a>B<)>

Enable inband forward error correction. B<packet_loss> must be non-zero
to take advantage - frequency of FEC 'side-data' is proportional to expected packet loss.
Default is disabled.


=item B<application (N.A.)>

Set intended application type. Valid options are listed below:


=over 4


=item B<voip>

Favor improved speech intelligibility.

=item B<audio>

Favor faithfulness to the input (the default).

=item B<lowdelay>

Restrict to only the lowest delay modes.

=back



=item B<cutoff (N.A.)>

Set cutoff bandwidth in Hz. The argument must be exactly one of the
following: 4000, 6000, 8000, 12000, or 20000, corresponding to
narrowband, mediumband, wideband, super wideband, and fullband
respectively. The default is 0 (cutoff disabled).


=item B<mapping_family (>I<mapping_family>B<)>

Set channel mapping family to be used by the encoder. The default value of -1
uses mapping family 0 for mono and stereo inputs, and mapping family 1
otherwise. The default also disables the surround masking and LFE bandwidth
optimzations in libopus, and requires that the input contains 8 channels or
fewer.

Other values include 0 for mono and stereo, 1 for surround sound with masking
and LFE bandwidth optimizations, and 255 for independent streams with an
unspecified channel layout.


=item B<apply_phase_inv (N.A.) (requires libopus E<gt>= 1.2)>

If set to 0, disables the use of phase inversion for intensity stereo,
improving the quality of mono downmixes, but slightly reducing normal stereo
quality. The default is 1 (phase inversion enabled).


=back




=head2 libshine


Shine Fixed-Point MP3 encoder wrapper.

Shine is a fixed-point MP3 encoder. It has a far better performance on
platforms without an FPU, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with LAME and other production-grade encoders quality-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.

This encoder only supports stereo and mono input. This is also CBR-only.

The original project (last updated in early 2007) is at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/projects/libshine-fxp/>E<gt>. We only support the
updated fork by the Savonet/Liquidsoap project at E<lt>B<https://github.com/savonet/shine>E<gt>.

Requires the presence of the libshine headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libshine>.

configuration.  You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libaom>.


=head3 Options


The wrapper supports the following standard libavcodec options:


=over 4



=item B<b>

Set bitrate target in bits/second.  By default this will use
variable-bitrate mode.  If B<maxrate> and B<minrate> are
also set to the same value then it will use constant-bitrate mode,
otherwise if B<crf> is set as well then it will use
constrained-quality mode.


=item B<g keyint_min>

Set key frame placement.  The GOP size sets the maximum distance between
key frames; if zero the output stream will be intra-only.  The minimum
distance is ignored unless it is the same as the GOP size, in which case
key frames will always appear at a fixed interval.  Not set by default,
so without this option the library has completely free choice about
where to place key frames.


=item B<qmin qmax>

Set minimum/maximum quantisation values.  Valid range is from 0 to 63
(warning: this does not match the quantiser values actually used by AV1
- divide by four to map real quantiser values to this range).  Defaults
to min/max (no constraint).


=item B<minrate maxrate bufsize rc_init_occupancy>

Set rate control buffering parameters.  Not used if not set - defaults
to unconstrained variable bitrate.


=item B<threads>

Set the number of threads to use while encoding.  This may require the
B<tiles> or B<row-mt> options to also be set to actually
use the specified number of threads fully. Defaults to the number of
hardware threads supported by the host machine.

Set the encoding profile.  Defaults to using the profile which matches
the bit depth and chroma subsampling of the input.


=back


The wrapper also has some specific options:


=over 4

=over 4


=item B<default>

Improve resilience against losses of whole frames.

=back

Not enabled by default.


=item B<crf>

Set the quality/size tradeoff for constant-quality (no bitrate target)
and constrained-quality (with maximum bitrate target) modes. Valid
range is 0 to 63, higher numbers indicating lower quality and smaller
output size.  Only used if set; by default only the bitrate target is
used.


=item B<static-thresh>

Set a change threshold on blocks below which they will be skipped by
the encoder.  Defined in arbitrary units as a nonnegative integer,
defaulting to zero (no blocks are skipped).


=item B<drop-threshold>

Set a threshold for dropping frames when close to rate control bounds.
Defined as a percentage of the target buffer - when the rate control
buffer falls below this percentage, frames will be dropped until it
has refilled above the threshold.  Defaults to zero (no frames are
dropped).


=item B<denoise-noise-level (>I<level>B<)>

Amount of noise to be removed for grain synthesis. Grain synthesis is disabled if
this option is not set or set to 0.


=item B<denoise-block-size (>I<pixels>B<)>

=item B<maxsection-pct (>I<pct>B<)>

Maximum percentage variation of the GOP bitrate from the target bitrate. If maxsection-pct

Range is -1 to 5000. Default is -1 (unset).


=item B<frame-parallel (>I<boolean>B<)>

Enable frame parallel decodability features. Default is true.


=item B<tiles>

Set the number of tiles to encode the input video with, as columns x
rows.  Larger numbers allow greater parallelism in both encoding and
decoding, but may decrease coding efficiency.  Defaults to the minimum
number of tiles required by the size of the input video (this is 1x1
(that is, a single tile) for sizes up to and including 4K).


=item B<tile-columns tile-rows>

Set the number of tiles as log2 of the number of tile rows and columns.

value is converted to QP units by dividing it by C<FF_QP2LAMBDA>,
clipped in the [0 - 10] range, and then multiplied by 6.3 to get a
value in the native libtheora range [0-63]. A higher value corresponds
to a higher quality.


=item B<q>

Enable VBR mode when set to a non-negative value, and set constant
quality value as a double floating point value in QP units.

The value is clipped in the [0-10] range, and then multiplied by 6.3
to get a value in the native libtheora range [0-63].

This option is valid only using the B<ffmpeg> command-line
tool. For library interface users, use B<global_quality>.

=head2 libwebp


libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper

libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.


=head3 Pixel Format


Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<-lossless> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.


=item B<-compression_level> I<integer>

For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the I<method> option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.


=item B<-qscale> I<float>

For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
I<global_quality> and must be multiplied by I<FF_QP2LAMBDA>.


=item B<-preset> I<type>

Configuration preset. This does some automatic settings based on the general
type of the image.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do not use a preset.

=item B<default>

Use the encoder default.

=item B<picture>

=head2 libx264, libx264rgb


x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libx264>.

libx264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and
4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC
entropy coding, interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations
for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

Many libx264 encoder options are mapped to FFmpeg global codec
options, while unique encoder options are provided through private
options. Additionally the B<x264opts> and B<x264-params>
private options allows one to pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted
by the libx264 C<x264_param_parse> function.

The x264 project website is at
E<lt>B<http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html>E<gt>.

The libx264rgb encoder is the same as libx264, except it accepts packed RGB
pixel formats as input instead of YUV.


=head3 Supported Pixel Formats


x264 supports 8- to 10-bit color spaces. The exact bit depth is controlled at
x264's configure time.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libx264 wrapper. The
B<x264>-equivalent options or values are listed in parentheses
for easy migration.

To reduce the duplication of documentation, only the private options

=head2 libxvid


Xvid MPEG-4 Part 2 encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libxvidcore headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libxvid --enable-gpl>.

The native C<mpeg4> encoder supports the MPEG-4 Part 2 format, so
users can encode to this format without this library.

The following options are supported by the libxvid wrapper. Some of
the following options are listed but are not documented, and
correspond to shared codec options. See B<the Codec
Options chapter> for their documentation. The other shared options

If set to I<auto>, the matrix matching the profile will be picked.
If not set, the matrix providing the highest quality, I<default>, will be
picked.


=item B<bits_per_mb> I<integer>

How many bits to allot for coding one macroblock. Different profiles use
between 200 and 2400 bits per macroblock, the maximum is 8000.


=item B<mbs_per_slice> I<integer>

Number of macroblocks in each slice (1-8); the default value (8)
should be good in almost all situations.


=item B<vendor> I<string>

Override the 4-byte vendor ID.
A custom vendor ID like I<apl0> would claim the stream was produced by
the Apple encoder.


=item B<alpha_bits> I<integer>

Specify number of bits for alpha component.
Possible values are I<0>, I<8> and I<16>.
Use I<0> to disable alpha plane coding.


=back



=head3 Speed considerations


In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher B<bits_per_mb> limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the B<qscale> parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.


=head2 QSV encoders


The family of Intel QuickSync Video encoders (MPEG-2, H.264, HEVC, JPEG/MJPEG and VP9)

The ratecontrol method is selected as follows:


=over 4


=item *

When B<global_quality> is specified, a quality-based mode is used.
Specifically this means either

=over 4


=item -

I<CQP> - constant quantizer scale, when the B<qscale> codec flag is
also set (the B<-qscale> ffmpeg option).


=item -

I<LA_ICQ> - intelligent constant quality with lookahead, when the
B<look_ahead> option is also set.


=item -

I<ICQ> -- intelligent constant quality otherwise.

=back



=item *

Otherwise, a bitrate-based mode is used. For all of those, you should specify at
least the desired average bitrate with the B<b> option.

=over 4


=item -

I<LA> - VBR with lookahead, when the B<look_ahead> option is specified.


=item -

I<VCM> - video conferencing mode, when the B<vcm> option is set.


=item -

I<CBR> - constant bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified and equal to
the average bitrate.


=item -

I<VBR> - variable bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified, but is higher
than the average bitrate.


=item -

I<AVBR> - average VBR mode, when B<maxrate> is not specified. This mode
is further configured by the B<avbr_accuracy> and
B<avbr_convergence> options.

=back


=back


Note that depending on your system, a different mode than the one you specified
may be selected by the encoder. Set the verbosity level to I<verbose> or
higher to see the actual settings used by the QSV runtime.

Additional libavcodec global options are mapped to MSDK options as follows:


=over 4


=item *

B<g/gop_size> -E<gt> B<GopPicSize>


=item *

B<bf/max_b_frames>+1 -E<gt> B<GopRefDist>

=item *

For the I<CQP> mode, the B<i_qfactor/i_qoffset> and
B<b_qfactor/b_qoffset> set the difference between I<QPP> and I<QPI>,
and I<QPP> and I<QPB> respectively.

=head2 VAAPI encoders


Wrappers for hardware encoders accessible via VAAPI.

These encoders only accept input in VAAPI hardware surfaces.  If you have input
in software frames, use the B<hwupload> filter to upload them to the GPU.

The following standard libavcodec options are used:

=over 4


=item *

B<g> / B<gop_size>

=item *

B<bf> / B<max_b_frames>

All encoders support the following options:

=over 4


=item B<low_power>

Some drivers/platforms offer a second encoder for some codecs intended to use
less power than the default encoder; setting this option will attempt to use
that encoder.  Note that it may support a reduced feature set, so some other
options may not be available in this mode.


=item B<idr_interval>

Set the number of normal intra frames between full-refresh (IDR) frames in
open-GOP mode.  The intra frames are still IRAPs, but will not include global
headers and may have non-decodable leading pictures.


=item B<b_depth>

Set the B-frame reference depth.  When set to one (the default), all B-frames
will refer only to P- or I-frames.  When set to greater values multiple layers
of B-frames will be present, frames in each layer only referring to frames in
higher layers.


=item B<rc_mode>

Set the rate control mode to use.  A given driver may only support a subset of
modes.

Possible modes:

=over 4


=item B<auto>

Choose the mode automatically based on driver support and the other options.
This is the default.

=item B<CQP>

=item B<CBR>

Constant-bitrate.

=item B<VBR>

Variable-bitrate.

=over 4


=item B<ac>


=item B<cabac>

Use CABAC.


=item B<vlc>


=item B<cavlc>

Use CAVLC.

=item B<aud>

Include access unit delimiters in the stream (not included by default).


=item B<sei>

Set SEI message types to include.
Some combination of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<identifier>

Include a I<user_data_unregistered> message containing information about
the encoder.

=item B<timing>

Include picture timing parameters (I<buffering_period> and
I<pic_timing> messages).

=item B<recovery_point>

Include recovery points where appropriate (I<recovery_point> messages).

=back



=back



=item B<hevc_vaapi>

B<profile> and B<level> set the values of
I<general_profile_idc> and I<general_level_idc> respectively.


=over 4


=item B<aud>

=item B<tier>

Set I<general_tier_flag>.  This may affect the level chosen for the stream
if it is not explicitly specified.


=item B<sei>

Set SEI message types to include.
Some combination of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<hdr>

Include HDR metadata if the input frames have it
(I<mastering_display_colour_volume> and I<content_light_level>
messages).

=back



=item B<tiles>

Set the number of tiles to encode the input video with, as columns x rows.
Larger numbers allow greater parallelism in both encoding and decoding, but
may decrease coding efficiency.


=back



=item B<mjpeg_vaapi>

Only baseline DCT encoding is supported.  The encoder always uses the standard
quantisation and huffman tables - B<global_quality> scales the standard
quantisation table (range 1-100).

For YUV, 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 subsampling modes are supported.  RGB is also
supported, and will create an RGB JPEG.


=over 4


=item B<jfif>

Include JFIF header in each frame (not included by default).

=item B<huffman>

Include standard huffman tables (on by default).  Turning this off will save
a few hundred bytes in each output frame, but may lose compatibility with some
JPEG decoders which don't fully handle MJPEG.

=back



=item B<mpeg2_vaapi>

B<profile> and B<level> set the value of I<profile_and_level_indication>.


=item B<vp8_vaapi>

B-frames are not supported.

B<global_quality> sets the I<q_idx> used for non-key frames (range 0-127).


=over 4


=item B<loop_filter_level>


=item B<loop_filter_sharpness>

Manually set the loop filter parameters.

=back



=item B<vp9_vaapi>

B<global_quality> sets the I<q_idx> used for P-frames (range 0-255).


=over 4


=item B<loop_filter_level>


=item B<loop_filter_sharpness>

Manually set the loop filter parameters.

=back


B-frames are supported, but the output stream is always in encode order rather than display
order.  If B-frames are enabled, it may be necessary to use the B<vp9_raw_reorder>
bitstream filter to modify the output stream to display frames in the correct order.

Only normal frames are produced - the B<vp9_superframe> bitstream filter may be
required to produce a stream usable with all decoders.


=back



=head2 vc2


SMPTE VC-2 (previously BBC Dirac Pro). This codec was primarily aimed at
professional broadcasting but since it supports yuv420, yuv422 and yuv444 at
8 (limited range or full range), 10 or 12 bits, this makes it suitable for
other tasks which require low overhead and low compression (like screen
recording).


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<b>

Sets target video bitrate. Usually that's around 1:6 of the uncompressed
video bitrate (e.g. for 1920x1080 50fps yuv422p10 that's around 400Mbps). Higher
values (close to the uncompressed bitrate) turn on lossless compression mode.


=item B<field_order>

Enables field coding when set (e.g. to tt - top field first) for interlaced
inputs. Should increase compression with interlaced content as it splits the
fields and encodes each separately.


=item B<wavelet_depth>

Sets the total amount of wavelet transforms to apply, between 1 and 5 (default).
Lower values reduce compression and quality. Less capable decoders may not be
able to handle values of B<wavelet_depth> over 3.


=item B<wavelet_type>

Sets the transform type. Currently only I<5_3> (LeGall) and I<9_7>
(Deslauriers-Dubuc)
are implemented, with 9_7 being the one with better compression and thus
is the default.


=item B<slice_width>


=item B<slice_height>

Sets the slice size for each slice. Larger values result in better compression.
For compatibility with other more limited decoders use B<slice_width> of
32 and B<slice_height> of 8.


=item B<tolerance>

Sets the undershoot tolerance of the rate control system in percent. This is
to prevent an expensive search from being run.


=item B<qm>

Sets the quantization matrix preset to use by default or when B<wavelet_depth>
is set to 5

=over 4


=item -

I<default>
Uses the default quantization matrix from the specifications, extended with
values for the fifth level. This provides a good balance between keeping detail
and omitting artifacts.


=item -

I<flat>
Use a completely zeroed out quantization matrix. This increases PSNR but might
reduce perception. Use in bogus benchmarks.


=item -

I<color>
Reduces detail but attempts to preserve color at extremely low bitrates.

=head1 SUBTITLES ENCODERS



=head2 dvdsub


This codec encodes the bitmap subtitle format that is used in DVDs.
Typically they are stored in VOBSUB file pairs (*.idx + *.sub),
and they can also be used in Matroska files.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<palette>

Specify the global palette used by the bitmaps.

The format for this option is a string containing 16 24-bits hexadecimal
numbers (without 0x prefix) separated by commas, for example C<0d00ee,
ee450d, 101010, eaeaea, 0ce60b, ec14ed, ebff0b, 0d617a, 7b7b7b, d1d1d1,
7b2a0e, 0d950c, 0f007b, cf0dec, cfa80c, 7c127b>.


=item B<even_rows_fix>

When set to 1, enable a work-around that makes the number of pixel rows
even in all subtitles.  This fixes a problem with some players that
cut off the bottom row if the number is odd.  The work-around just adds
a fully transparent row if needed.  The overhead is low, typically
one byte per subtitle on average.

By default, this work-around is disabled.
