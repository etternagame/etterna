The Golden Rules of StepMania 5 Development
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to CodingStyle.txt, this is the doctrine for operation of SM5.

1) If you want something done, you should probably work on it yourself. However,
SSC members should be willing to help if their area of expertise and the problem
domain overlap (life permitting).

2) Always know your priorities. StepMania is not your life.
Take breaks every once in a while. Work on other things.
Don't get burned out from nonstop development.

3) Patches should be checked for compatibility/compilability before being
accepted and integrated. Common sense, but a golden rule nevertheless.

4) Anyone who decides to theme during development is willing to accept that
occasionally, changes to the default and/or fallback theme will break things.
