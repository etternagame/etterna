.ssc Format Changelog
________________________________________________________________________________
In case anyone else wishes to implement the .ssc format in their own simulator,
a changelog is provided here between each version.

Notice: .ssc is not a finalized format at the moment. There are plans for a
change to JSON, but it is unsure if this will be done.

Implement .ssc at your own risk.

[v0.82] - cerbo
* add #PREVIEWVID tag. (to load the preview video, like #PREVIEW tag in .sma)

[v0.81] - freem
* add #JACKET, #CDIMAGE, and #DISCIMAGE tags. (similar to #BANNER, etc.)

[v0.80] - Wolfman2000
* All timing tags are allowed regardless of timing.

[v0.79] - freem
* Back to three significant decimal places.

[v0.78] - Wolfman2000
* Use the step timing/attack tags only when required. The presence of even
  ONE timing tag causes all to be used, so be careful with it.

[v0.77] - Wolfman2000
* Add the cache tag #STEPFILENAME to gain access to the proper #NOTES when
  required.

[v0.76] - Wolfman2000
* Expand the #COMBOS tag to allow for Miss Combos. Anyone that is crazy enough
  to put in a 51 miss combo in their tags should be...oh wait: it's already
  been done.

[v0.75] - Wolfman2000
* Add Step based #DISPLAYBPM for those songs that have...very varied syncing.

  on load.

  equivalents.

* Split Timing officially implemented.
