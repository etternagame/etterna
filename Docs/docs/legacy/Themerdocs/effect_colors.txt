General note on functions that use effect colors:
diffuseblink, diffuseramp, diffuseshift, glowblink, glowramp, and glowshift all use the two effect colors.
They set the effect colors to white when called, so you should call effectcolor1 and effectcolor2 afterwards to set the effect colors to the colors you want.
You should also call effectperiod to set the effect period if you don't want the default of 1.

Example:
Def.Quad{
	Name= "glow quad test", InitCommand= function(self)
		self:setsize(40, 40)
		self:glowshift()
		self:effectcolor1(color("#dc322f"))
		self:effectcolor2(color("#2aa198"))
		self:effectperiod(4)
		self:xy(_screen.cx, _screen.cy)
	end
}
