This is the "One Screen Example Theme".
It's a very minimal theme with a single screen showing two rectangles and the decorations that ScreenWithMenuElements has built in by default.
You can try it out by copying it into the Themes folder.

Since this theme only has one screen, and no code to handle transitions or a normal method of accessing the options, in order to change to another theme you'll have to access the options menu by pressing the service key, which is mapped to Scroll Lock by default.


Parts of this theme:
metrics.ini
ThemeInfo.ini
BGAnimations/ScreenSimpleExample overlay.lua
