The following is a list of known issues with StepMania 5.

* The course editor is not working. (It could stand to be rewritten.)

* The scoring system needs to be made global for the game instead
  of tying it to the theme. The current arrangement causes multiple problems
  (themes not supporting scoring unless they explicitly add it to gameplay
  decorations, the last note not being scored, and so on).

* The C and V keys in the editor (related to attacks) still has
  work to go. Crashes should hopefully be minimal if not otherwise
  nonexistant.

* Attacks involving noteskins do not work. They may never work again unless
  some internal coding issues are figured out.

* Routine mode (dance or pump) isn't perfect yet.
 * Attempting to use the Jukebox to show Routine steps will lead to an infinite
   loop that is not escapable short of killing the program.
 * Attempting to select routine mode in the Practice menu causes a crash.

* The attempted unlock code written around Previews 2-4 (?) does not seem to
  work at this time. Assistance may be needed here.

* Hold/Roll heads seem to be draw under preceding taps when they
  shouldn't be all the time.

* C-Mods have not been fully tested with all of the new segments yet.
  Warp segments are ignored when C-Mods are used.

* Split Timing needs adjustments with only one chart in place.
 * Either that, or all tags must be allowable in song timing.

* Language detection fails for Czech and possibly other things on OS X
  (non-fatally, now)

* Japanese font maps are too large and get resized on load to something
  manageable. They should be cut into thirds vertically.
 * This makes debug builds in particular load very slowly, and reduces quality.

* The editor sometimes keeps playing music and won't scroll.

* VBR MP3's don't seek correctly in the editor, which botches sync.

* There is no make install target for linux systems - this is important for
  packaging purposes in particular (it would be great to release .debs!)

* LuaDriver works well, but without threading it has latency issues.

* Survival courses crash if you set a noteskin in the player options
  just before starting the course.

* On some graphics cards, 3D models may cause crashes.
