Miscellaneous Simfile Formats without directories
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[MSD]
Along with BMS, the grand daddy of simfile formats.

[PMS]
It's pretty much like BMS. If you really need documentation,
see src/NotesLoaderPMS.cpp I guess. I'm not going to make a folder for it when
it's a BMS derivative :x.

[KMS]
Like BMS but for Keyboardmania? See http://wiki.bms.ms/KMS:Spec

[GDA]
Like BMS but for Session (Guitar Freaks/drummania). See http://wiki.bms.ms/GDA:Spec

[pydance]
They call it ".dance". I call it ARGH. See dance-spec.txt for the info.

Obscure old Japanese formats.
