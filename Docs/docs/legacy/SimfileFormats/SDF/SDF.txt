Basically a compressed version of a .SM that includes the banner and background
in the file as well.

{Banner}
{Background}
{SDF data}

When running SM2SDF.exe with /log, the process looks like this:

test_sm2sdf.sm is the equivalent of test.sm in the above example.
test.sdf is the output file, with two BPMs.
test-1bpm.sdf is an output file with only one BPM change (and a changed offset).
the two images are included as well.

A cursory glance at the steps part of the .SDF shows this:

0x00-0x04: [000204060A]
0x05-0x??: Title (first byte is number of characters/length of string)
then Subtitle, Artist, and Credit follow the same pattern.
That's followed by the Offset. +1.000 = 0x0003E8. -0.060 = 0x01003C.
I think they call this binary coded decimal.

After that is the number of BPMs, presumably followed by those BPMs.
0x0007D0=0x0A2C2B == #BPMS:2.000=666.667;
I'm just not sure how they're picking the places to store the decimal.
