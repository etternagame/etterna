These are the 'official' version designations: 
 * "experimental: pre-release versions
 * "private beta v0.0": hmm, think about it for a second there.
 ==Public versions below this line==
 * "v0.0 alpha #": Alpha versions (bug squashing, polishing until we reach beta)
 * "v0.0 beta #": Beta versions (bug squashing, _focus_ is on high priority bugs)
 * "v0.0 rc#": Release Candidates (if there are no problems, move on to final)
 * "v0.0": Final Releases
