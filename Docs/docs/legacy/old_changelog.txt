sm-ssc Changelog (mainly source code related)
_________________________________________________________________________
All changelogs go by SVN revision number* for the time being.

Not all changes are documented, as some were later reverted and other
features are meant to be undocumented for various reasons.

Some changes are grouped together even though the commits may have
happened at different times.

All times are in 24 hour format, Central Standard Time (UTC-6) unless between
dates where daylight savings time is in effect in the United States (then
it's UTC-5).

sm-ssc Private Beta Wave 1.1 | 20091208
---------------------------------------
The next Private Beta release will be termed Wave 1.1, and will be released
to current sm-ssc beta testers on December 8th, 2009.

Bugfixes aren't listed here unless they're source code-related, usually.
See the bugtracker at http://ssc.ajworld.net/sm-ssc/bugtracker/ for bugs/feature
requests and their status.

In addition to the bugfixes, the following changes have been made:

r130 | 20091203 15:17:13
------------------------
Two new GameCommands:
* fademusic,fVolume,fDuration (though I wish fDuration was how long to fade the
  music for; instead the fade lengths are consts in GameSoundManager.)
* pushscreen,sScreenName (though it doesn't push screens like I had thought it
  would. maybe I'm doing it wrong.) [AJ]

r129 | 20091202 21:56:54
------------------------
Modified character camera values. [shakesoda]

r128 | 20091202 01:16:28
------------------------
* Profile name max length changed from 12 to 32 characters.

r127 | 20091201 23:43:10
------------------------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] new metric SamplePreviewMusicMode, which has one of two
  possible values as of r127. 'SamplePreviewMusicMode_Normal' is business as
  usual (sample music plays), while 'SampleMusicPreviewMode_ScreenMusic'
  disables song samples, using /{theme}/Sounds/ScreenSelectMusic loop music.*
  as the file to play. No, this doesn't support Lua music yet. [AJ]

sm-ssc Private Beta Wave 1 | 20091201
-------------------------------------
The list below comprises sm-ssc Private Beta Wave 1's changes. Some of the
changes are from baseline StepMania 4 SVN, in order to keep compatibility.

r126 | 20091130 23:18:28
------------------------
* Add improved cel shading for people with GLSL support. [shakesoda]

r125 | 20091130 18:18:43
------------------------
* [Course.cpp] GetPlayMode() and GetCourseType() return actual enums now,
  instead of numbers.

r124 | 20091130 14:45:37
------------------------
* [StepMania.cpp] (any)Shift+F2 = reload metrics only.
  F2 = reload metrics and textures.

r123 | 20091129 14:42:34
------------------------
* [TimingData] add GetActualBPM() Lua binding that returns a table holding the
  min and max BPMs, in that order.

r122 | 20091127 23:31:32
------------------------
* Add OptionsListTimeout [shakesoda]

r121 | 20091127 15:57:10
------------------------
* Disable color keying banners (it's 2009, I don't think anyone is using the
  old rotated banners anymore. -aj) [shakesoda]

r112-r120 | 20091126 17:28:56-22:13:57 (SSC turkey day)
-------------------------------------------------------
* [Song] new Lua bindings: NormallyDisplayed(), GetStepsSeconds()
* Themes will load Lua scripts from subdirectories first now.

r111 | 20091122 10:21:30
------------------------
* [ArchHooks_Unix] Follow user's system language as default.
  [David Santamaría Rogado (howl)]
  See http://old.stepmania.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21471 for more info.

r110 | 20091120 14:03:17
------------------------
* Fixed a crash with lifemultipliers > 1.0 in debug builds

r109 | 20091117 11:05:29
------------------------
* F2 reloads metrics again, just like in StepMania 3.9. (This is probably one
  of those changes that won't get backported to baseline StepMania...)
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] version 0.5 of ToastyTriggersAt added; only allows for
  one value, unlike 3.9+ (which used a String with multiple values). The final
  version will use a Lua table, similar to [MusicWheel] SortOrders.

r108 | 20091116 02:19:05
------------------------
* [CharacterManager] GetAllCharacters() Lua binding added.

r107 | 20091116 02:03:41
------------------------
* [Character] new Lua bindings: GetModelPath(), GetRestAnimationPath(),
  GetWarmUpAnimationPath(), GetDanceAnimationPath()
* [CharacterManager] GetRandomCharacter() Lua binding added
* [RageFileManager] GetDirListing(sPath,bOnlyDirs,bPathToo) Lua binding added

r106 | 20091115 21:33:28
------------------------
* Prevent focus lost at Fullscreen on X11, fix windowed->fullscreen resolution
  changes so that they save [David Santamaría Rogado (howl)]
  (http://old.stepmania.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21430)

r105 | 20091114 15:07:58
------------------------
* Add support for .oga and .ogv files. [David Santamaría Rogado (howl)]
  (http://pastie.org/698741)

r104 | 20091113 22:13:47
------------------------
* Fix a crash in StepsDisplay that allows Course mode to at least run.

r103 | 20091113 21:23:42
------------------------
* sm4svn r28233 [Glenn Maynard]:
  "Fix ThemeMetric<EnumType> gives the first value of the enum when the theme
  metric is nil, instead of EnumType_INVALID.
  This happened because ThemeMetric was setting the value to its default,
  eg. EnumType(), when LuaHelpers::FromStack returned false.
  This behavior doesn't make sense in the general case, since EnumType() results
  in an arbitrary value (the first one) rather than Invalid. Every FromStack
  function sets a reasonable default on invalid data, anyway, and only RageColor
  and enums can return false in any case.
  This fixes CustomDifficulty when CourseType = nil."

r102 | 20091111 04:00:46
------------------------
* MusicWheelItem SetMessage has a new param, Type (string that returns the
  item type).
* Add sort songs by most recently played. (As of this writing, it's not
  feature-complete yet.)

r101 | 20091109 19:33:55
------------------------
* Implemented David Santamaría Rogado (howl)'s patch for loading Splash.png instead of an .xpm
(http://old.stepmania.com/forums/showpost.php?p=157340&postcount=3)

r089-100 | 20091103 01:45:01 - 20091109 04:01:31
------------------------------------------------
Okay let's just say it's r089 to r100 and call it a week.

* Changes from SM4SVN:
 * r28211: [HighScore.cpp] "logic fixup" [Glenn Maynard]
 * r28215: "default to showing backgrounds in editor" [Chris Danford]
 * r28217: "Fix crash on reload metrics due to faulty FlushDirCache logic."
 [Steve Checkoway], implemented along with code that was originally submitted
 as r076 but removed. See this fix log to figure out why we'd bother. :)
 * r28218: "crash handler is crashing in 2.6.31 in GetBacktrace, causing a
 recursive crash handler crash that we aren't handling, leading to recursion"
 [Glenn Maynard]
 * r28219: "add 'DIRRO' driver for read-only access" [Glenn Maynard]
 * r28220: "fix confusing comment. Escaping doesn't affect this; commas aren't
 escaped, since they're split from the value itself, long after MsdFile is
 loaded." [Glenn Maynard] (We'll be keeping the 1,1,1,1 colors in sm-ssc, and
 may provide a compatibility script for SM4SVN, so be on the lookout.)
 * r28221: "allow overriding, like PRODUCT_ID" [Glenn Maynard]
 * r28222-28223: "adding support for pms files" [GRIM657]
 * The pulseaudio patch [David Santamaría Rogado (howl), OndÅ™ej HoÅ¡ek, Damien ThÃ©bault]
   (see http://old.stepmania.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21348)
 * Greg Nadja's OpenGL/Windows patch

* sm-ssc Changes:
 * [ScreenSelectMusic.cpp] Add SelectMenuInputMessage, has params Player and
 Button. Broadcast messages when holding select and a button other than Select
 is pushed.
 * Windowed mode is now the default display mode.
 * [HighScore.cpp] new Lua bindings:
  * GetModifiers()
  * GetTapNoteScore(TapNoteScore)
  * GetHoldNoteScore(HoldNoteScore)
  * GetRadarValues()
 * [ProfileManager.cpp] added IsSongNew(Song) Lua binding

r088 | 20091101 12:19:47
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28203-28208, all by Glenn Maynard.
 * r28203: "skip exporting round data when nothing was played (no taps, no holds)"
 * r28204: "fix signatures not being written" (we had this already)
 * r28205: "don't fail if there's no course; just hide"
 * r28206: "move course rename and delete into Overview"
 * r28208: "disable rename and delete for courses that havn't been saved yet"
r28207 was a theme edit.

r087 | 20091029 15:48:06
------------------------
sm4svn r28202: helper for cycling through an enum [Glenn Maynard]

r086 | 20091028 22:20:40
------------------------
sm4svn r28201: "refactor RageInput to not call GetDevicesAndDescriptions
constantly; it can be slightly complex and get called thousands of
times a second" [Glenn Maynard]

r085 | 20091027 18:17:54
------------------------
* Allow for Codes on ScreenGameplay.
* New Lua bindings for ScreenGameplay:
 * PauseGame(bool) - Pauses/unpauses the game.
 * IsPaused() - returns true or false depending on if the game is paused or not.

r084 | 20091027 04:40:01
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28198-28200
 * r28198: Fix GetFileSizeInBytes to return an int instead of unsigned.
   "this returns -1 on error (this should actually be 64-bit,
   but that's a bigger change)" [Glenn Maynard]
 * r28199: The official log is as follows:
   "Hack to get the decorations to be deleted. Fixes crashes,
   but probably not the best way to go about this."
   In addition to doing this, it adds GetChildren() to ActorFrame in the
   code itself. (It already existed in Lua, I just felt like pointing
   this out. :D) [Steve Checkoway]
 * r28200: The official log is as follows:
   "Do not use an AutoActor to keep track of the children."
   However, this also fixes the hack in r28200. [Steve Checkoway]

r083 | 20091015 02:52:45
------------------------
* Support loading Lua scripts from subdirectories of the Scripts folder,
  to allow for better organization. The scripts in the root Scripts folder
  will run first, then any Lua scripts in subdirectories of the Scripts folder
  will be run. It currently only works with one folder depth, for example:
  Scripts/subfolder/script.lua.

  This is not likely to be changed. If you can see a possible need for paths
  like Scripts/subfolder/subfolder2/script.lua, please make a Feature Request
  ticket on the bugtracker at http://ssc.ajworld.net/sm-ssc/bugtracker/ with
  an explanation of what you have in mind.

r082 | 20091012 02:53:51
------------------------
* Change BitmapText defaults to no stroke + no shadow.
* Added DefaultTheme preference in order to fix crashes.
  (sm-ssc's fallback theme is _fallback [and therefore normally unselectable].)

r081 | 20091005 22:13:23
------------------------
* [NotesLoaderSM.cpp] Changes based on SM4SVN r28197 [Archer]

r080 | 20091002 15:56:01
------------------------
* Event Mode turned on by default, as it should be. :)

r079 | 20090925 21:20:49
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28192-28196.
 * r28192: HexToBinary for RString -> RString. [Glenn Maynard]
 * r28193: show all songs in EditCourse, not just preferred songs [Chris Danford]
 * r28194: [ScreenDebugOverlay] Glenn made this themeable in SM4SVN, finally
   catching up. This means we've had to rename a few things:
    * DebugMenuHeader -> HeaderText
    * PageName -> PageText
   ButtonText and FunctionText were added, as well.
   The font names remain the same, only the metrics change.
   (Can you believe they're still using Common normal as the font?)
 * r28195,28196: fix ComboChanged message sent when m_bSendJudgmentAndComboMessages
 is false, fix doing unnecessary work in multiplayer [Glenn Maynard]

r078 | 20090920 00:43:33
------------------------
* [StepsDisplay] Fixed it so it actually shows up again.

r077 | 20090919 20:31:54
------------------------
Happy talk like k//eternal day!
* [Font.cpp] Don't show strokes by default.
* [NoteDisplay] fRotation -> fRotationZ in anticipation of multiple rotation mods.
* [PaneDisplay] changed one thing that used a goto; doesn't use it anymore. seems to work for me, though I'm not 100% sure.
* [ThemeManager] don't reload Lua scripts when you reload the metrics.
  This is a temporary fix, and may be deemed safe at some point in the future.

r076 | 20090914 03:42:25
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28190,28191 (25 files worth). This was later reverted, as it caused
reloading the metrics to crash. Since sm-ssc is primarily for themers, this is a
dealbreaker. A lot of things were unofficially added to sm-ssc at this point:

* [ActorFrame] Added RemoveAllChildren() and RemoveChild(sName) bindings.
  These are not guaranteed to work. Don't use them. They are very dangerous.
* [IniFile] added Lua's '--' syntax for commenting (along with '//' and '#',
  which were already supported).
* New blend modes Modulate (subject to renaming later) and AlphaMultiply.
* [RageUtil] Added various bindings for formatting time that were already built
  into StepMania: SecondsToHHMMSS, SecondsToMMSSMsMs, SecondsToMMSSMsMsMs,
  SecondsToMSS, SecondsToMMSS. All bindings take in a float (number of seconds).
* [RageUtil] Added IsHexVal(string) binding.
* Added groups to sort length (based on BPM ranges), so the songs no longer
  show up without groups.

r075 | 20090914 00:41:36
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28189.

r074 | 20090913 12:52:05
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28180-28185.

r073 | 20090913 01:57:12
------------------------
* Added WeightedMultiply and InvertDest blend modes to Direct3D.

r072 | 20090912 17:15:16
------------------------
* Change decorations draw order so it breaks things less.

r071 | 20090911 01:29:41
------------------------
* "hidden" removed from Actor commands. It was deprecated.
  A compatibility alias was added to replicate its functionality. However, this
  will not work with NoteSkins, so be sure to make sure to check them for the
  use of hidden.

  Handy replacement guide:
  hidden,true  / hidden,1 = visible,false
  hidden,false / hidden,0 = visible,true

r070 | 20090907 03:01:22
------------------------
* Add Sprite:CropTo() function + Lua binding.

r069 | 20090906 03:59:10
------------------------
* Base theme changed from "default" to "_fallback".
  As a result, all themes will fallback on _fallback.
  _fallback is more or less the SM4SVN default.

r068 | 20090905 21:05:17
------------------------
* [ScreenWithMenuElements.cpp, ThemeManager.cpp] Load and parse Lua as music.
  This makes conditional music possible.

r067 | 20090905 19:00:37
------------------------
* add URLEncode Lua binding to RageUtil.

r066 | 20090904 14:19:28
------------------------
* Change many things on ScreenEdit to go 5 decimal places instead of 3.
* Beginnings of Xbox controller mappings for edit mode (untested)
* [REDACTED] preference renamed to be less specific but more accurate.

r065 | 20090903 04:21:31
------------------------
* Binding naming format changed for BPM bindings. Always uses all caps BPM.
  Changes in the codebase due to this:
  * [Song] HasSignificantBpmChangesOrStops -> HasSignificantBPMChangesOrStops
  * [TimingData] HasBpmChanges -> HasBPMChanges
* [TimingData] New bindings. (GetStops, GetBPMsAndTimes)
* [ScreenPackages] attempt to not call MoveLeft by duplicating code.
  Seemed to work okay.

r064 | 20090831 02:53:36
------------------------
* [ActorScroller] Make naming of commands consistent (some were all lowercase,
  some were CamelCase), all are now CamelCase.
  todo: add aliases in the _fallback theme for compatibility with
  regular SM4 themes.

r063 | 20090831 02:48:44
------------------------
ScreenPackages changes:
* Backgrounds from Sprites to AutoActors (Lua can be used now).
* DefaultUrl metric added.

r062 | 20090829 04:00:16
------------------------
* Add metric for determining how to judge jumps:
  [Gameplay] LastOrMinimumTapNoteScore
  and an enum (TapNoteScoreJudgeType) to go with it. This idea was inspired
  by PumpMania (Zmey, et al).
  (This commit was later reverted, as it caused crashes.)

r061 | 20090828 00:29:08
------------------------
* Added ScreenGameplay:GetPlayerInfo(PlayerNumber) Lua binding

r060 | 20090827 03:27:21
------------------------
* Added LifeChanged message to LifeMeterBattery, meaning certain hackily-coded
  custom life meters by a certain SSC member can work in Oni mode again. ;)
* MAX_EDIT_STEPS_SIZE_BYTES changed from 30KB to 60KB.
* Added --theme= and --language= command line options.

r059 | 20090826 03:16:45
------------------------
* SSE2 build configuration (Visual Studio 2008 project files only).
* new Lua bindings for WheelBase: IsSettled(), IsLocked()

r058 | 20090822 16:14:18
------------------------
* Implement --version command line argument. Prints out the version of sm-ssc.
  Please build sm-ssc with HAVE_VERSION_TIME if possible. Untested on Linux/Mac.

r057 | 20090822 03:21:14

------------------------
* [GameCommand.cpp] add GetUrl() Lua binding.
* [GameManager.cpp] add IsGameEnabled(Game) Lua binding.
* removing player color diffuse commands, in the hopes this can be replicated
  using Lua commands.
  [GrooveRadar.cpp, ScoreDisplayLifeTime.cpp, ScreenSelectMusic.cpp]
* [CommandLineActions] Version() stub; when implemented, should print out
  version number and quit.
* [GrooveRadar] name m_GrooveRadarValueMap "RadarValueMap(P1/P2)"
  (commands untested); new todo note in header file
* [ScoreDisplayOni.cpp] give it a name ("ScoreDisplayOni Numbers") and run
  commands. (untested)
* various pedantic edits, maybe some commenting
  [Actor.cpp, GameCommand.cpp, MusicWheel.cpp, NotesLoaderBMS.cpp,
  ScreenSelect.cpp]

r054 | 20090810 14:36:10
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28170 (vdl's fixes for Xbox building; he says they should be tested.)

r053 | 20090815 07:18:10
------------------------
* add GetPathO() Lua binding

r052 | 20090810 12:09:00
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28140-r28166 (code changes only)

r051 | 20090808 03:11:39
------------------------
* SM4SVN r28135, r28137, r28138
* Lossless screenshots now save as PNG.
* Conversion of decorations to not be children of the screen; they load in
  a similar fashion to overlay/underlay, but still using LoadB so everything
  works correctly. (Tested against SM4 default theme for compatibility.)

r050 | 20090729 22:57:52
------------------------
* add GetRotationX, GetRotationZ commands to Actor

_____________________________________________________________________________
Footnotes:
* The actual revision numbers are different for various reasons.

1) Currently, sm-ssc is being held in the general purpose SSC SVN repository,
which includes other projects, such as themes and non-StepMania related items.
What's called r001 in this changelog is actually r285 of the SSC SVN repo.
r107 in the changelog is r1146 in the SSC SVN repo, just to give you an idea
of something more recent.

2) Other projects are being developed within sm-ssc (as demonstrations of some
of the more advanced things you can do with the platform) and are best served
living within the repository for the time being.

3) The commit logs in here are distilled over the reality of our commits.
This is done for a few reasons. The first is that some changes span multiple
commits... let's compare what the changelog says is r106 with the actual
commits in a similar format to the changelog. Everything you see after the
dashes is the actual uncut and unchanged commit log messages. Commit numbers
use the actual SSC SVN revisions.

==================================================================
For the most part, the commit logs that the sm-ssc devs (AJ, Midiman, and
shakesoda) enter aren't always the most descriptive. Some of them are also
not really safe for viewing. :s

Plus, the rewrites let us expand on what was originally written in the commit
log, and/or edit it for better readability.

(Also let it be said that those logs aren't the norm for commits. The ones
I end up doing are similar to what ends up in the changelog, mainly for my own
convienence.)
