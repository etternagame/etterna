________________________________________________________________________________

2016/06/28
----------
* [Gameplay] Moved pause menu logic to a script in _fallback.  Added
  documentation to help other themes implement a pause menu.

2016/06/24
----------
* [SelectMusic] Added AllowHoldForOptions preference to disable holding start
  to go to the player options screen. [kyzentun]
* [General] Back button will only back out of the screen on a press, not when
  it is still being held from the previous screen. [kyzentun]

2016/06/12
----------
* [ScreenSyncOverlay] Moved actors to lua to make them themable. [kyzentun]

2016/06/09
----------
* [Gameplay] Ready and Go announcer sounds no longer play simultaneously.  If
  the Ready animation doesn't exist and the Go animation exists, only the
  Go announcer sound is played.  If neither animation exists, only the Ready
  announcer sound is played. [kyzentun]

2016/06/07
----------
* [NotesWriterSM] Stops, delays, and warps that occur on the same row are now
  summed correctly.  Fixes bug that deleted warps that were on the same row
  as a stop. [kyzentun]
* [Sound] Ignore invalid SoundDriver preference. [kyzentun]

2016/06/06
----------
* [Language] Traditional Chinese translation added. [ddrtime]

2016/05/25
----------
* [MemoryCards] Fixed bug that caused loading profiles from usb drives to
  crash. [djpohly]

2016/05/20
----------
* [Global] Removed UndocumentedFeature lua function because it was just a way
  to crash with a message. [kyzentun]


2016/05/11
----------
* [Minimaid] Fixed crash that occurred when the minimaid lights driver was
  selected, but no minimaid device was connected. [wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0.11 | 20160401
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016/03/22
----------
* [Prefs] Added DisableUploadDir preference to skip saving a score entry to
  Save/Upload every time a song is played.  Generating the unique filename
  can take several seconds when there are years of scores accumulated, and it
  clutters the disk.  This preference defaults to false. [kyzentun]

2016/03/17
----------
* [Actor] Added get and set_tween_uses_effect_delta lua functions to make an
  Actor use the effect clock for tweening. [kyzentun]

2016/03/15
----------
* [ProfileManager] Added GetStatsPrefix and SetStatsPrefix lua functions for
  separating scores into different stats files. [kyzentun]
  (this is kind of a stop gap, I'd really like to rewrite scoring to save
  more data so that a score earned with one set of timing windows and weights
  can be converted to the equivalent score with different timing windows)

2016/03/14
----------
* [Online] Stepmania will force disconnection from the SMO server when
  entering the jukebox or sync calibration screens to avoid crash. [kyzentun]

2016/03/05
----------
* [global] get_sound_driver_list lua function added. [kyzentun]

2016/03/02
----------
* [Gameplay] Fixed No Fakes mod to remove fakes inside warps. [kyzentun]
* [Keymaps] Added special name for colon key so it can be bound. [medmig]

2016/02/20
----------
* [Language] Bahasa Indonesian translation added to default theme. [JOELwindows7]

2016/02/15
----------
* [Input] Linux event devices now start at JOY10 instead of JOY1.  Without
  this change, if one dance pad is a joystick device, and the other is an
  event device, they will both be JOY1, and stepmania will think they are the
  same dance pad.  If you use Linux, assume that you have to remap your dance
  pad. [kyzentun]

2016/02/13
----------
* [Lights] Minimaid driver added for Linux.  This is practically identical to
  the Windows minimaid driver that pkgingo wrote.
* [Gameplay] When checking for the first second in a song, AutoKeysound notes
  are now ignored, being treated as if they were background music. This
  allows the intro of BMS files to play as soon as ScreenGameplay is loaded,
  while still having a delay before the real notes come in. [nixtrix]

2016/02/04
----------
* [Course] In an Endless course, songs will only be repeated after all songs
  in the group have been played. [blindbox]

2016/02/03
----------
* [ScreenManager] Added PlayInvalidSound, PlayStartSound, PlayCoinSound,
  PlayCancelSound, and PlayScreenshotSound lua bindings. [kyzentun]
  Added get_input_redirected and set_input_redirected to allow the theme to
  disable the normal input functions.  (Example: a custom lua menu on
  Select Music.  When the menu is up, the theme doesn't want the player's
  input to move the music wheel.)  This is in SCREENMAN so that it will work
  on all screens. [kyzentun]
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Added CanOpenOptionsList lua binding.  OpenOptionsList
  will do nothing if CanOpenOptionsList returns false. [kyzentun]

2016/01/18
----------
* [Edit Mode] Added "Clear timing in region" to timing menu. [kyzentun]
  Fixed crash that occurs when "Paste timing data" is used after copying a
  region of timing data that only contains stops. [kyzentun]

2016/01/14
----------
* [Gameplay] Added pause menu to default theme.  Activated by pressing
  Select, or Back twice without pressing something else.  Has options for
  restarting or forfeiting the current song in normal play.  Course mode has
  options for skipping the current song or ending the course or forfeiting.
  [kyzentun]
* [Graphics] When fetching the list of resolutions, only 32bpp modes are
  tested because less than 32bpp is not supported on Windows 8 and newer, and
  because the bpp doesn't matter when fetching a list of resolutions.  This
  speeds up the load time of the Graphics/Sound option screen. [kyzentun]

2016/01/10
----------
* [RageFile] Lua functions for RageFile should now emit an error when the
  file was not opened correctly instead of crashing. [kyzentun]

2016/01/05
----------
* [Linux] Disable DPMS on startup and restore setting on exit. [kyzentun]

2015/12/27
----------
* [RageFileManager] Ignore OS X special files in GetDirListing. [kyzentun]

2015/12/20
----------
* [Fonts] Fixed crash bug in Texture Font Generator. [drewbarbs]

2015/12/16
----------
* [Player] ChangeLife and SetLife functions added. [kyzentun]

2015/12/13
----------
* [popn] Judgment levels in popn game mode now use W1 to W5. [parashep]

2015/12/05
----------
* [Player] Guitar mode cruft removed from Player. [tertu]

2015/12/04
----------
* [NoteField] Changed DrawBeatBar to check the M-mod so that smaller beat
  bars are drawn when M-mods are used in edit mode. [kyzentun]

2015/11/09
----------
* [Gameplay] BG Brightness is no longer forced to 100% on songs that only
  have a beginner chart. [kyzentun]

2015/11/08
----------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Using lua music files for the section music and similar
  things works now. [kyzentun]

2015/11/05
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Fixed bug that was clearing the noteskin back to default.
  [kyzentun]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0.10 | 20151031
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015/10/29
----------
* [Language] French translation updated. [Arvaneth]

2015/10/27
----------
* [Compiling] Link with /MT on windows instead of /MD. [wolfman2000]
* [Fonts] Put Texture Font Generator back in package. [wolfman2000]
  Build Texture Font Generator when WITH_FULL_RELEASE or
  WITH_TEXTURE_GENERATOR is enabled. [wolfman2000]

2015/10/26
----------
* [Song] Added GetMainTitle lua function for bypassing ShowNativeLanguage
  preference. [kyzentun]

2015/10/25
----------
* [Compiling] Number of jobs used when building ffmpeg can be customized by
  WITH_FFMPEG_JOBS. [wolfman2000]
  Appveyor support added for automated windows building. [wolfman2000]

2015/10/23
----------
* [BMS] Fixed crash when an unknown type chart was in a bms. [kyzentun]

2015/10/21
----------
* [Actor] Changed PlayCommandNoRecurse so that setting a theme metric to a
  function that doesn't exist doesn't emit an error. [kyzentun]
* [Compiling] Allow WITH_MP3=Off and WITH_WAV=Off to compile. [wolfman2000]
* [EditMode] Fixed crash on missing ScreenMiniMenuTimingDataChangeInformation
  metrics. [kyzentun]
* [ScreenEvaluation] Changed assert that occurs when leaving ScreenGameplay
  with SM_GoToNextScreen to give more info. [kyzentun]

2015/10/20
----------
* [Compiling] Fixed cmake error when compiling with -DWITH_SSE2=off. [wallacoloo]
  Don't define CPU_X86 on non-x86. [wallacoloo]
* [Noteskins] If the fallback for a noteskin is not found, that noteskin is
  not loaded, to prevent picking it and crashing. [kyzentun]

2015/10/18
----------
* [BitmapText] Added set_mult_attrs_with_diffuse lua function. [kyzentun]

2015/10/17
----------
* [Course] Fixed loading of courses that use WORST entries. [wolfman2000]
* [SextetStream] SextetStream stuff is now in all platforms. [wolfman2000]

2015/10/15
----------
* [BMS] Changed bms loading so that iidx bms files aren't loaded as kb7.
  [zardoru]

2015/10/12
----------
* [ActorMultiVertex] Fixed bug that *sometimes* caused diffuse to be applied
  to verts wrong. [kyzentun]

2015/10/11
----------
* [Song] Changed song loading to allow a song to have a blank MusicFile field
  if the song has any keysounds.  A blank MusicFile entry can result from
  having '#' in the music file name, or be intended for bms files.  Do not use
  '#' in any fields, the .sm and .ssc file formats do not support it.  The
  engine has to detect that the field was loaded blank and look through the
  song folder to figure out what was supposed to be there. [kyzentun]

2015/10/09
----------
* [Edit Mode] Changed Current Second field to not have the global offset
  added in.  People were using one global offset for syncing to workaround
  the problem and sync by comparing the Current Second in Edit Mode to the
  current second in a music editor.  The workaround of using a different
  global offset for syncing should no longer be necessary. [kyzentun]
* [Input] Fixed input lockup caused by scrolling the mouse wheel.  Why wasn't
  this reported sooner? [kyzentun]

2015/10/07
----------
* [ActorFrame] ActorFrame:SetDrawByZPosition now returns self.  Missed a spot
  when implementing function chaining. [kyzentun]
* [Gameplay] MaxRegenComboAfterMiss preference brought in.  When a step is
  missed in gameplay, the combo has to get back up to RegenComboAfterMiss
  before the player starts regaining life.  If MaxRegenComboAfterMiss is
  greater than RegenComboAfterMiss, then each successive miss increases
  RegenComboAfterMiss until it reaches RegenComboAfterMiss.
  MaxRegenComboAfterMiss defaults to 5, the same as RegenComboAfterMiss, so
  there should be no behavior change unless the preference is manually
  changed. [dbk2]
* [Gameplay] When disqualification was turned on via Preferences, the old
  logic exhibited two problems:
  1. charts with attacks were always disqualified from ranking
  2. charts without attacks could be disqualified from ranking if the attack
    modifier was set to "Off"
  So, this commit fixes those problems.  If a chart has attacks, and the
  attack modifier is used to turn them "Off", then disqualification is
  enforced.
  Additionally, disqualification is enforced if the attack modifier is set to
  "Random Attacks."  This part might not be necessary, but I acted on the
  assumption that random attacks could theoretically make a chart easier.
  [dbk2]

2015/10/04
----------
* [FFmpeg] Upgrade FFmpeg to 2.1.3 for Windows. [wolfman2000]
* [FFmpeg] Fixed cmake WITH_SYSTEM_FFMPEG option. [lthls]

2015/10/03
----------
* [FFmpeg] Upgrade FFmpeg to 2.1.3 for Mac OS X. [wolfman2000]
* [Gameplay] Fixed timing to apply the current music rate to the global
  offset so that playing at different music rates doesn't make a chart off
  sync. [Matt McCutchen]

2015/10/02
----------
* [Edit Mode] .sm files will no longer be saved when split timing is used
  because per-chart timing cannot be done in the .sm format. [kyzentun]
* [Scoring] Fixed bug that caused missed holds to be recorded as held in the
  value returned by PlayerStageStats:GetRadarActual(). [kyzentun]

2015/09/21
----------
* [Sprite] Added set_use_effect_clock_for_texcoords for toggling whether the
  tex coord velocity uses the effect clock instead of the time.

2015/09/10
----------
* [MusicWheel] Fixed SetItemPosition so that it actually passes the item
  index and the number of items to the transform function. [kyzentun]

2015/09/09
----------
* [Notefield] Fixed bug where the hold body doesn't scroll if it goes off the
  top of the screen. [waiei]

2015/09/08
----------
* [Compiling] Compiling stepmania on Windows with the locale set to Japanese should work now. [wolfman2000]

2015/09/06
----------
* [Preferences] Fixed crash on Advanced Input Options on OS X caused by the
  Axis Fix preference not existing on OS X.  The preference does nothing on
  OS X, but the game no longer crashes on that screen. [kyzentun]

2015/09/03
----------
* [Fonts] Respliced large kanji sprite sheets from 32x106 and 32x61 to 63x54
  and 48x41 to bring them under 4096 pixels tall, which was causing a forced
  resize and slowing down loading time. [kyzentun]
* [Gameplay] Fixed song position updating logic so that the
  ScreenGameplay:PauseGame lua function actually pauses the game.  Start,
  Select, and Back are all used for different ways of giving up, so the
  feature remains unused in the default theme. [kyzentun]

2015/09/02
----------
* [Gameplay] Fixed Player logic that spammed TNS_AvoidMine repeatedly. [kyzentun]

2015/08/29
----------
* [Edit Mode] Fixed crash on entering edit mode caused by entering edit mode
  as Player 2.  Edit Mode only works as Player 1. [kyzentun]

2015/08/23
----------
* [BMS] Added myo2 channel layout and kb7 charts.  Added preview point and
  fixed offset support and linear solo bms layout. [zardoru]
* [Linux] Symbolic links will be followed to find the actual executable dir. [Wallacoloo]

2015/08/20
----------
* [Minimaid] Minimaid support built in by default instead of off by default. [wolfman2000]
* [Options] Put AllowExtraStage on Advanced Options screen in default. [kyzentun]

2015/08/19
----------
* [Gameplay] RandomBGEndsAtLastBeat metric defaults to true to be similar to
  old behavior. [wolfy852]

2015/08/08
----------
* [General] When the HighResolutionTextures preference is set to Auto,
  StepMania checks whether the display height is greater than the theme
  height instead of whether it's greater than 480. [shakesoda]

2015/08/04
----------
* [PIUIO] Only send LightState changes to PIUIO when there is a change. [dbk2]

2015/08/02
----------
* [NoteField] Fixed bottomcap when NoteDisplay is zoomed out. [hanubeki]

2015/07/22
----------
* [Compiling] Fixed building on 32bit linux. [kyzentun]

2015/07/19
----------
* [Pump] Added TimingWindowSecondsCheckpoint for the timing window that
  checkpoint holds allow you to release for. [wolfman2000]

2015/07/18
----------
* [General] Fixed bug that skipped notes on beat 0 in score. [kyzentun]

2015/07/16
----------
* [ActorUtil] ActorUtil.ResolvePath and ResolveRelativePath now take a
  boolean flag to tell if the thing is optional. [kyzentun]
* [CryptMan] Fixed bug that clipped hash strings with zeros. [kyzentun]

2015/07/15
----------
* [Sprite] Sprite now executes the AnimationFinished command when it reaches
  the end of its animation and starts over. [kyzentun]

2015/07/11
----------
* [ScreenMapControllers] If the AutoDismissWarningSecs metric is less than
  .25 seconds, the warning will not be shown (the TweenOn command for it will
  not be played).  Instead, the NeverShow command will be played.  If the
  NeverShow command does not exist for the warning actor, the warning actor
  will be set to hibernate forever. [kyzentun]

2015/07/02
----------
* [Gameplay] Random background video behavior is now controlled by these
  three metrics in the Background section:
  RandomBGStartBeat sets the beat of the music the first random bg occurs on.
  RandomBGChangeMeasures sets the number of measures between changes.
  RandomBGChangesWhenBPMChangesAtMeasureStart toggles the behavior in its name.
  RandomBGEndsAtLastBeat toggles the behavior in its name.

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0.9 | 20150520
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015/06/10
----------
* [global] get_music_file_length lua function added. [kyzentun]

  the speeds by. [kyzentun]

* [RageSound] get_length lua function added. [kyzentun]

2015/06/06

  initial screen. [kyzentun]

2015/06/05
----------
* [global] update_centering lua function exposed. [kyzentun]
* [ScreenOverscanConfig] New screen in _fallback for interactively adjusting
  the preferences that already existed for dealing with overscan. [kyzentun]
* [Actor] BlendMode_Subtract no longer crashes on the d3d renderer.  It does
  not do subtraction blending correctly, this just prevents the crash.
  [kyzentun]

2015/06/03
----------
* [Actor] bounce and bob effects no longer round pixel coords. [kyzentun]
* [RageFile] Exposed Flush function to Lua. [kyzentun]

2015/05/29
----------
* [OptionsList] The OptionsListQuickChange, OptionsListLeft, and
  OptionsListRight messages now have a Selection parameter that has the id of
  the selection the player moved to. [nixtrix]

2015/05/24
----------
* [Gameplay] Autokeysounds are no longer twice as loud when playing
  keysounded charts with two players. [nixtrix]

2015/05/15
----------
* [BMS] .lua files defined in the #BMP tags now work as BG animations, and the
  #difficulty tag is now supported. [nixtrix]
* [general] BackInEventMode code now works when called from either player.
  [nixtrix]
* [cmake] JACK is now properly found by CMake.
* [theme] Preview music fadeout time is now adjustable by the metric
  SampleMusicFadeoutSeconds. [nixtrix]
* [Song] Setting a sample length of 0 uses the length of the entire preview
  file. [nixtrix]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0.8 | 20150510
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015/05/10
----------
* [General] Screenshots are not tagged with song title or screen name because
  this causes problems when titles have UTF8 or slashes. [kyzentun]

2015/05/09
----------
* [general] Workaround for the axis problem added.  Set the Axis Fix
  preference under Input Options to true if you have the axis problem.
  [Fighter19]
* [general] Added XML to Lua converter.  See Docs/Themerdocs/XmlToLua.txt for
  details. [kyzentun]

2015/05/08
----------
* [compiling] Added -DWITH_CRYSTALHD_DISABLED cmake options to allow more
  users to build on Linux. [wolfman2000]

2015/05/05
----------
* [Gameplay] Holding Select on gameplay now skips the current song in course
  or endless mode. [kyzentun]

2015/04/30

  default scratch key, key7 is now mapped to right instead of key3.
  Backwards and shuffle chart mods now ignore the scratch column. [jobn]

2015/04/27
----------
* [general] "Do not show again" button on missing texture dialog works now.
  If the background or banner file for a song doesn't exist when the song is
  cached, the cache file will have a blank path so Stepmania won't try to
  load the nonexistent banner or background.

2015/04/25
----------
* [General] Screenshot key now checks whether there is a current song, and
  puts the song title and current screen name in the screenshot filename. [kyzentun]

2015/04/24
----------
* [Gameplay] Toasty animation can now occur multiple times during gameplay. [kyzentun]

2015/04/23
----------
* [ServiceMenu] Entries in service menu rearranged to hopefully organize them
  better.  ScreenOptionsInputSub and ScreenOptionsDisplaySub added.  Updating
  a theme to show the options for the new screens should be a simple matter of
  changing the LineNames entry for ScreenOptionsService to include
  "InputOptions" and "SoundGraphics". [tuxdude]

2015/04/18
----------
* [EditMode] Fixed bug that made alter menu choices prompt for clearing. [kyzentun]
* [NoteColumnRenderer] Added handling for diffuse and glow to make rainbow
  and related effects work. [kyzentun]

  until after the chart is played. [kyzentun]

  copying, and pasting any or all timing segments in the selected region or
  after the current cursor position. [kyzentun]

  beats. [kyzentun]

  locale. [Wallacoloo]

2015/04/03
----------
* [ScreenGameplay] The NoteField board is now underneath everything except
  the backgound.  This means underneath any custom actors on the underlay or
  overlay or decoration layers, and also underneath the combo/judgment even
  when the ComboUnderField metric is true. [kyzentun]
  Fixed bug in screen filter in default theme that made it not appear under
  the field when a solo file was played without Center1Player. [kyzentun]

2015/04/02
----------
* [global] commify function exposed to lua. [kyzentun]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0.7 | 20150401

----------
* [Select Music] Ctrl+Shift+R mapped to reload the current song. [kyzentun]
* [Song] ReloadFromSongDir lua function exposed. [kyzentun]
* [Preferences] NeverCacheList preference added.  It's a comma separated
  list of group names, if a song is in one of the named groups, it is never
  cached. [kyzentun]

2015/03/27
----------
* [Select Music] Ability to delete the current song by pressing Ctrl+Backspace added. [Wallacoloo]

2015/03/24
----------

=======
================================================================================
StepMania 5.0.7rc | 20150309
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015/03/09
----------
* [EditMode] Autosave every 5 minutes added. [kyzentun]
* [General] NotesLoaderSM, NotesLoaderSSC, IniFile::ReadFile rewritten,
  load times substantially faster. [kyzentun]
* [Preference] HarshHotLifePenalty preference added, for toggling whether
  LifeMeterBar takes away .1 life when it's full. [kyzentun]

2015/03/08
----------
* [EditMode] Clearing an area now prompts for confirmation if it contains
  EditClearPromptThreshold notes or more.  EditClearPromptThreshold is a
  preference that can be set in the Advanced Options section, or in the
  options in Edit Mode. [kyzentun]

2015/03/05
----------
* [Graphics] DX9 support improved, giving a large speed boost and fixing the
  problem that made people get stuck with 16bit color. [xwidghet]

2015/03/04

  [kyzentun]

  0. [kyzentun]
* [Song] GetPreviewMusicPath added. [kyzentun]

  Fixed crash when deleting steps. [kyzentun]
* [InputMapper] Backslash can be mapped now. [kyzentun]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0.5 | 20150214
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015/02/12
----------
* [InputMapper] Added D-Force Automappings [shakesoda]

2015/02/04
----------
* [ActorFrame] GetUpdateRate added. [kyzentun]
* [Background] Using the wrong transition name no longer crashes.
  Playback rate is applied to videos.
  Checkerboard and other BackgroundEffects that use the same file twice no
  longer play videos back at multiplied speed. [kyzentun]
* [Sprite] Get/SetDecodeMovie added. [kyzentun]

2015/02/03
----------
* [MusicWheel] HideActiveSectionTitle metric added. [djpohly]

2015/02/02
----------
* [ActorMultiVertex] ForceStateUpdate and Get/SetDecodeMovie added. [kyzentun]
* [RageTexture] Get<thing>Width and Height functions added.
  (<thing> means Source, Texture, or Image) [kyzentun]
* [Scripts] find_missing_strings_in_theme_translations function added to
  _fallback scripts to assist translators in finding what needs to be
  translated.  If you need/want to run it on your them, write a piece of lua
  like this:
  find_missing_strings_in_theme_translations("_fallback", "en.ini")
  The first arg is the folder name of the theme to look at.
  The second arg is the name of the language that is fully translated.  All
  other languages will be compared to it to decide what is missing or unused.
  [kyzentun]
* [Song] GetBGChanges added. [kyzentun]

2015/02/01
----------
* [ActorMultiVertex] Animation state system added.  AMVs can now have
  animated textures controlled by states written in lua. [kyzentun]

2015/01/31
----------
* [EditMode] Want more lead in time before recording starts?
  It's a preference.  [kyzentun]

2015/01/30
----------
* [Actor] Wrapper states added.  This makes wrapping an Actor inside an
  ActorFrame for any reason unnecessary, and makes it possible to do things
  that were only possible by wrapping an Actor in an ActorFrame to Actors
  that you couldn't put inside a frame before. [kyzentun]

2015/01/20
----------
* [ScreenSelect] ChoiceNames can be a lua command that is evaluated to get a
  list of the gamecommands.  The main use of this is to get rid of the huge
  list of metrics that ScreenSelectStyle requires.  A single lua function
  instead of a metric for every style for every game type. [kyzentun]
* [ScreenSelectMaster] IconChoicePosFunction metric added.  This metric is
  optional, if it's set, it must be set to a function that returns a table
  of positions.  Each position is a table of the form "{x, y, z}", where x,
  y, and z are numbers and any that is not a number defaults to 0.
  The function is passed the number of choices for the screen.
  IconChoiceOnCommand and IconChoiceOffCommand metrics added so each choice
  doesn't require its own On/OffCommand pair.  These are also optional, but
  if they are set, they will override the individual commands if they exist.
  (If "IconChoiceCactusOnCommand" and "IconChoiceOnCommand" both exist,
  "IconChoiceOnCommand" will be used.) [kyzentun]
  Example:
  # in metrics.ini
  IconChoicePosFunction=choice_positions
  -- In a file in Scripts/
  function choice_positions(count)
    local ret= {}
    for i= 1, ret do ret[i]= {i*24, i*48} end
    return ret
  end

2015/01/16
----------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] HardCommentMeter metric added.  Sets the meter that
  will trigger the "select music comment hard" announcer sound. [kyzentun]

2015/01/12
----------
* [ScreenOptions] GetNumRows function added. [kyzentun]

2015/01/09
----------

2015/01/06
----------

  [kyzentun]
* [NoteColumnRenderer] Functions for fetching the spline handlers for the
  column added. [kyzentun]
* [NCSplineHandler] New class for setting various parameters of a spline used
  by a NoteColumnRenderer and containing the spline. [kyzentun]
* [CubicSplineN] New class that provides spline functionality. [kyzentun]

2014/12/26
----------
* [NoteField] Columns turned into actors that can be fetched with
  get_column_actors. [kyzentun]

  Disqualification, FailOffForFirstStageEasy, FailOffInBeginner,
  LockCourseDifficulties, InputDebounceTime, MaxHighScoresPerListForMachine,
  and MaxHighScoresPerListForPlayer added to service options.
  InputDebounceTime is in Input Options, the rest are in Arcade Options.
  (might not show up in themes that customize the order and placement of the
  preferences) [kyzentun]

2014/12/18
----------
* [Profile] GetTotalDancePoints added. [kyzentun]

2014/12/10
----------
* [EditMode] Play whole song and play from current beat will now play until
  either the music or the notes end, whichever is greater. [kyzentun]
  The screens used for setting the options used to play the screen and for
  adding attacks can be set through the "OptionsScreen" and "SetModScreen"
  metrics in the ScreenEdit section.
* [GameState] ApplyPreferredSongOptionsToOtherLevels function added. [kyzentun]
* [Player] "ComboBreakOnImmediateHoldLetGo" theme metric added. [sillybear]
* [PlayerState] ApplyPreferredOptionsToOtherLevels function added. [kyzentun]
  
2014/12/07
----------
* [Game] GetSeparateStyles function added.  Use this to detect whether a game
  allows the players to play different styles. [kyzentun] (used by kickbox)
* [GameManager] Lua Scripts/ folders are now reloaded when the Game mode is
  changed. [kyzentun]
* [GameState] CanSafelyEnterGameplay function added. [kyzentun]
  In kickbox game mode, players can have different styles set, pass a
  PlayerNumber when using SetCurrentStyle or GetCurrentStyle.
* [kickbox] New game mode with 4 styles. [kyzentun]
* [ScreenGameplay] Notefield positioning is handled a bit differently now.
  See comments in _fallback/metrics.ini above the [ScreenGameplay]
  MarginFunction metric.  Basically, you can define a lua function that
  returns the space you want at the edges and in the center instead of
  setting position metrics.  Do NOT use Style:GetWidth to calculate the
  margins your function returns.
  ScreenGameplay now handles zooming the notefield to fit in the space
  instead of using the NeedsZoomOutWith2Players flag in the style.
  If the notefield doesn't fit in the space between the margins, and there is
  only one player, the player will be centered even if the Center1Player pref
  is false. [kyzentun]
* [Style] NeedsZoomOutWith2Players decapitated.  Always returns false now.
  GetWidth added. [kyzentun]
* [techno] Techno game mode no longer has special column width for versus.
  Techno was the only game mode that used the NeedsZoomOutWith2Players flag,
  and the zoom factor it applied was 0.6, and the special versus column width
  was 0.6*normal, so this should make no difference. [kyzentun]

2014/12/03
----------
* [command line arg] --game command line arg added for setting the game type
  when starting stepmania. [sillybear]
* [Announcer] "evaluation full combo W3" and "evaluation full combo W4"
  responses added. [sillybear]

2014/12/01
----------
* [ScreenMapControllers] Forced sanity checking of key mappings added.
  Start, MenuLeft, MenuRight, and Operator keys must be mapped.
  Reset key mappings option added to debug menu for recovering from an
  unusuble keymap without needing to find and delete KeyMaps.ini. [kyzentun]

2014/11/30
----------
* [NoteField] New functions added for controlling the receptor and ghost arrow
  (explosion) flashes. [kyzentun]

2014/11/28
----------
* [Profile] Guest and Test profile types added.  All existing and new
  profiles are Normal.  If a profile is changed to Guest through the profile
  management screen, it will always show at the top of the list.  A profile
  set to Test will always be at the bottom of the list.  Profiles can be
  moved around in the list.
  GetType and GetPriority lua functions added to Profile.
  Bug that caused a crash when a profile dir was renamed to a non-number and
  a new profile was created fixed. [kyzentun]
* [Everything] Actor and singleton functions that formerly returned nothing now
  return the actor or singleton. Example (set zoom, x, y, and diffuse in one):
  self:zoom(.5):xy(_screen.cx, _screen.h-60):diffuse(color("#dc322f"))
  This also works for PlayerOptions and SongOptions API functions.  Pass true
  as an extra arg, and they can be chained.

2014/11/22
----------

* [PlayerOptions] MinTNSToHideNotes mod added. [kyzentun]

  after creating new steps. [Wolfman2000]

2011/10/16

  Mirror is back in its old position. [Wolfman2000]

----------

  and WasLoadedFromAdditionalCourses(course) Lua bindings. [AJ]
* [CryptManager] Add GenerateRandomUUID() Lua binding. [AJ]
* [ThemeManager] Added DoesThemeExist(sTheme), IsThemeSelectable(sTheme),
  DoesLanguageExist(sLang), GetCurThemeName(), HasMetric(sGroup,sValue), and
  HasString(sGroup,sValue) Lua bindings. [AJ]

2011/08/23
----------
* [Makefile.am] Fixed version date and time handling. [AJ]

2011/08/22
----------
* [PrefsManager, X11Helper] Added ShowMouseCursor preference. [AJ]
* [UnlockManager] Added GetStepOfAllTypes Lua binding. This gets the locked
  Steps for all game types based on the difficulty specified. [Wolfman2000]
* [UnlockManager] Added requirepasschallengesteps Lua binding. This is more
  self-explanitory: pass challenge to be able to play edits. [Wolfman2000]

2011/08/21
----------
* [NotesLoaderSSC] Fix loading pre-split timing files that had blank timing
  tags inside of them. Thanks to Vin.il for the catch. [Wolfman2000]
* [Song] Added Jacket, CD image (a la early DDR), and Disc (PIU-style) support.
  Added GetJacketPath(), GetCDImagePath(), GetDiscPath(), HasJacket(), HasDisc(),
  and HasCDImage() Lua bindings. [AJ]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 3 | 20110820
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/08/20
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Add GetMMod() Lua binding. [AJ]
* [Player] Make keysounds respect volume preference. Fixes issue 344. [AJ]

2011/08/19
----------
* [Steps] Add PredictMeter() and GetDisplayBPMType() Lua bindings. [AJ]
* [Song] Add ShowInDemonstrationAndRanking() Lua binding. [AJ]
* Turn off Autogen by default. [shakesoda]
* Disable automatic aspect ratio guessing, default to 854x480
  (16:9 because most newer displays are wide). [shakesoda]
* Turn on FastLoad and FastLoadAdditionalSongs by default. [shakesoda]

2011/08/18
----------
* [RageInput] Added "No input devices were loaded." string to languages. [AJ]
* [RageInputDevice] Added localized names for InputDeviceState. [AJ]
* [Course] Add IsPlayableIn(StepsType) and IsRanking() Lua bindings. [AJ]
* [Trail] Added GetTotalMeter(), GetLengthSeconds(), IsSecret()
  and ContainsSong(song) Lua bindings. [AJ]

2011/08/16
----------
* Added PrettyPercent(numerator,denominator) Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/08/14
----------
* [Foreground] Restore Foreground Changes for use in gameplay. Note that it
  is recommended to use lua for #FGCHANGES from now on: not all XML changes
  will work. [infamouspat]

2011/08/13
----------
* [Theme-side] Added Fancy UI Background preference to Theme Options. [AJ]
* [LowLevelWindow_X11] Don't force the window into the upper left corner. [ZipFile]

2011/08/07
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added LostLife param to LifeChanged message. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Converted LifeMeterBattery lives to an AutoActor. [AJ]
* [TimingData] Add HasDelays() Lua binding; HasStops() now only checks stops. [AJ]
* [GameState, SongUtil] Fix Issue 263 by not charging 2x stages for doubles when
  not using joint premium. [AJ]
* [BeginnerHelper] Made BeginnerHelper run the OnCommand. [AJ]
* [GameState] add GetExpandedSectionName() Lua binding. [AJ]
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Added IdleCommentSeconds metric and
  "ScreenSelectMusic IdleComment" announcer sound. [AJ]
* [NotesLoaderBMS] "Send the actual song file to LoadFromBMSFile in
  BMSLoader::LoadNoteDataFromSimfile instead of the dummy one...
  This fixes the wrong sound issue [423]..." [theDtTvB]

2011/08/06
----------
* [NoteSkins/beat/default] Fix Issue 425. [AJ]
* [ScoreDisplayRave] Allow (Meter/Level)(X/Y) metrics to work again. [AJ]

2011/08/05
----------
* [NoteField] Added AreaHighlightColor metric. [AJ]

2011/08/04
----------
* [NoteTypes, ScreenEdit] Removed artificial MAX_NOTES_PER_MEASURE limit. [AJ]

2011/08/02
----------
* [NotesSSC] Only write timing/attack tags for the step if there is a
  difference from the song. For timing tags, at this time it means that if even
  one tag is different, all tags are written. [Wolfman2000]

2011/08/01
----------
* [MusicWheel, RoomWheel] Moved the "- EMPTY -" string to the languages file. [AJ]

2011/07/31
----------
* [ScreenGameplay, LyricDisplay] Stop lyrics from animating on failure.
  Fixes issue 298. [AJ]

2011/07/30
----------
* [ProfileManager] Fix an issue when deleting recently created profiles. [AJ]
* Start removing anything related to Guitar mode. This was rushed in, and it
  is not worth us keeping at this time. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/26
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a semi working implementation of the often requested
  copy/paste selected timing data feature. This should make it easier for
  some charters. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/21
----------
* [BeginnerHelper] Removed DancePadAngle metric in favor of DancePadOnCommand.
  The same goes for PlayerAngle, dancer rotation is now handled in
  PlayerP1/2OnCommand. [AJ]
* [Course] Bumped up max edit course title length to 16 (still feels too short).
  Also added #DESCRIPTION tag and Course:GetDescription() Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/07/20
----------
* [Win32/CrashHandlerChild] Crashlog and log now open in the player's default
  text editor. Also, the Show Log button works again, including for people using
  Portable.ini. [AJ]

2011/07/19
----------
* [LoadingWindow] Added the ability for themes to have custom splash banners.
  (Currently Windows-only.) [AJ]

2011/07/17
----------
* [Cache] No longer store #NOTES in the cache. This should speed things up
  on the first load if there is not much to write. (General note: this was
  taken from another branch, but results at that point were great.)
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/13
----------
* [Difficulty] Allow ALL StepsTypes to use CustomDifficulty properly.
  There was some unfair targeting of Couple and Routine. [Wolfman2000]
* [Steps] Calculate accurate radar values for Couple charts. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Display more accurate chart data for Couple and Routine charts
  for the future. No more having (almost) every row as a jump! [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/12
----------
* [OptionRowHandler] Add a new metric to ScreenOptionsMaster:
  StepsUseChartName. Use this if you want your charts to have a unique name
  in the options menu. If there is no #CHARTNAME or it is "Blank", it reverts
  to the original behavior. This metric is false by default. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fixed a bug involving #ATTACKS. Now when you set an attack,
  the mods are reverted back to how they were prior to the attack being set.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/09
----------
* [NotesTheUsual] Update the #COMBOS tag to allow for a Miss Combo attribute.
  Any files that only use the Combo attribute will have that value copied to
  miss combo on next launch. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] Better match #COMBOS with eval. Scoring formulas should
  not be affected, but it may require more testing. [Wolfman2000]
* [Metrics] Have Pump mode lump the checkpoint judgments with Flawless and
  Miss judgments on eval. Of course, this goes down to Perfect and Miss if
  that is disabled. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/07
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix the NoMines transformation bug, issue 363. [Wolfman2000]
* [CourseLoaderCRS] Don't load BEST# and WORST# where # is greater than the
  number of songs installed. Fixes issue 373. [AJ]
* [NotesAllSSC] Add the #CHARTNAME tag to the Steps. #DESCRIPTION is now for
  more detailed descriptions, or perhaps some short hand lingo. All files
  that used #DESCRIPTION will have their values moved to #CHARTNAME on
  load. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add a Steps Data menu for getting numerical step data on the
  chart. This is a read only menu. Edit Steps Information contains writable
  information. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesAllSSC] Add the Steps version of #DISPLAYBPM. The Song version is
  still there, so themes should not have to worry about breakage.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/06
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix the bug where hitting Enter during playing wouldn't take
  the user back to the editor. [Wolfman2000]
* [Gameplay] Fix Fail mods being dishonored. [Midiman]

2011/07/05
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Restore dance-couple and pump-couple for editing purposes.
  Saving should still work, but this was never tested yet. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenOptions] Mini is now ITG Mini, and Tiny is now Pump Pro Mini.
  This will prevent many prior courses from breaking. [sharksoda, Wolfman2000]
* [CharacterManager] Add a lua function to check how many characters you have.
  For an example of how this is used, check the default theme's scripts
  folder, specifically 03 ThemePrefs.lua. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/04
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function to switch the notes the routine players have to
  hit. In simple terms, Player 1's notes are now Player 2's and vice~versa.
  Check it out in the Alter Menu. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add two routine mirroring functions. Now you can build sections
  of a chart for one player, and mirror the effect for the other player when
  finished. For Pump players, it is not a straight mirror, but is more akin
  to what is found via normal routine charts. In other words, you'll be happy.
  Check it out in the Alter Menu. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/03
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix a crash if one tries to remove an attack that doesn't
  exist at that time. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 2 | 20110703
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/07/03
----------
* [Player] Bring mMods from OpenITG over. Also, a metric was added,
  "MModHighCap", to cap the speed mod if required for playing songs like
  Tsuhsuixamush. Set the metric to 0 or less to remove the cap. [AJ, sharksoda,
  Wolfman2000]

2011/07/02
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fixed a crash when hitting Enter in the F1 help menu. [AJ]

2011/06/30
----------
* [NotesAll] Use #FIRSTSECOND, #LASTSECOND, and #LASTSECONDHINT instead of the
  former BEAT equivalents. Split Timing has made this a necessity thanks to
  certain files that abuse Stops/Delays more than usual. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function in the Area Menu to designate the current beat
  as the last second of the song. Please try to be smart and not use this too
  early. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/28
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function to copy/paste the TimingData of a player's
  choice. Remember to be in the appropriate mode when copying and pasting.
  By default, the song timing is already located in the clipboard, ready for
  use. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/27
----------
* [Steps] Make sure #ATTACKS are copied when requested. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Have Step Author up front instead of Chart Style. This is
  probably going to be better overall. [Wolfman2000]
* [TimingData] Preserve the length of time for Speed Segment scaling when using
  beats. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoader/WriterSSC] #OFFSET is to be before #ATTACKS. This is required if
  we pursue beat based attacks and not just second based. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/26
----------
* [UnlockManager] New metric: AutoLockEditSteps. Use this to hide bonus charts
  until the Expert steps are beaten. No guarantee that this works with no
  challenge steps in the song. This defaults to false. [Wolfman2000]
* [UnlockManager] New metric: SongsNotAdditional. Set to true to keep the
  default behavior, false to have the AdditionalSongs folder contain
  unlockable material. This is set to true to start. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow jumping between all segments, not just Label segments.
  You still use Ctrl + ,/. to jump, but now you use Ctrl + N/M to cycle the
  segments. By default, it starts with Label. [Wolfman2000]
* [PlayerOptions] No longer display StepAttacks in the player's list.
  Instead, show NoAttacks if attacks are disabled. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/24
----------
* [Actor] Implement compound(length,tweens) in _fallback/02 Actor.lua. [AJ]
* [UnlockManager] Add a new unlock reward: StepsType. This is similar to
  unlocking Steps, but it is targeted for one step in one stepstype rather
  than one step in all stepstypes. This needs testing. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add the option to convert delays to beats. Just find a better
  song to use this on besides Uprock. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fix a crash if you don't save any steps on a new song.
  [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoader/WriterSSC] Add support for Step #ATTACKS. Furthermore, Song
  Attacks (or rather, Step Attacks as it should be called now) are turned on
  by default instead of off. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/19
----------
* [EditMenu] Allow all songs to work in Practice Mode, regardless of folder
  location. This fixes a crash if everyone had songs in AdditionalSongs.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/17
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Fixed a bug where MinesSubtractLives was not being honored.
  Also added LifeChanged message to changing of life on holds. [AJ]

2011/06/15
----------
* [TimingData] Added many lua bindings for the other timing segments. GetWarps,
  GetCombos, GetTimeSignatures, GetTickcounts, GetFakes, GetScrolls, GetSpeeds.
  This should cover all of them now. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/13
----------
* [InputHandler_DirectInput] Fixed MouseWheel input not resetting. [AJ]
* [ScreenTextEntry] Make it so only the keyboard's Enter key can finish the
  screen. Should fix issues with buttons whose secondary function is MenuStart. [AJ]
* [InputMapper] Modify default mappings. Use the Hyphen key instead of the
  Numlock key for Player 2's GAME_BUTTON_BACK. This should address some
  issues with Player 2 being unable to back out if they use a laptop.
  [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDisplay] Add two new metrics.
 * DrawRollHeadForTapsOnSameRow: bool, similar to DrawHoldHeadForTapsOnSameRow
 * TapHoldRollOnRowMeansHold: bool, true means hold and false means roll
 * No noteskins should require updating, as these were placed in common/common
   for ease of use. [Wolfman2000]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added ChangeLives(int) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added DangerThreshold metric. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added some important metrics. [AJ]
 * MinScoreToKeepLife='TapNoteScore_*' - any score below this = loss of life.
 * SubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when going below MinScoreToKeepLife.
 * MinesSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when hitting a mine.
 * HeldAddLives=0 - how many lives are gained when a hold is completed.
 * LetGoSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost on a dropped hold.

2011/06/12
----------
* [ScreenNetSelectMusic] Add PlayerOptionsScreen metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenEdit] Restore the old PageUp/PageDown behavior, added Control +
  PageUp/PageDown to use recent time signature behavior. Laptop users, that
  includes you guys too: semicolon and apostrophe are still good. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/11
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow setting the Music Preview via the Alter Menu. Just select
  your area, enter the menu, and choose "Designate as Music Preview". No more
  math calculations needed! [Wolfman2000]
* [SongUtil] Added GetPlayableSteps(Song) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [Steps] Allow 255 characters for all chart descriptions, including edits.
  We are no longer bound by In The Groove I think. [Wolfman2000]
* [Player] Add GetPlayerTimingData() Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/10
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Split the Area Menu into the Area Menu and Alter Menu. Use the
  "A" key to enter the Alter Menu when a selection of notes/rows are
  highlighted. Use the Enter key to enter the old Area Menu for the options that
  do not depend on selecting NoteData. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow converting selections to Delays, Warps, or Fakes as well
  as Stops. Remember, use the Alter Menu for this. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/09
----------
* [ScreenSyncOverlay] Ensure that F11 / F12 work with all charts due to Split
  Timing. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/08
----------
* Any notes in a fake segment or warp segment are completely ignored for
  scoring purposes. Now you can get 100% on your warping goodness!
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/06
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Removed the ScoreDisplay mod choices. Use lua to make your
  own scoring formulas that work in reverse instead. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenGameplay] Fix an assist tick bug if there was no Player 1. Note that
  this changes the behavior slightly: it is the first enabled player, or
  master player, that gets the ticks now. A better solution will be looked at
  in the future. [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDataUtil] Fix a radar issue involving hands. Unfortunately, this means
  yet another cache reload for accuracy purposes. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/04
----------
* Changed default MusicWheelSwitchSpeed to 15 (was 10). [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Fixed a bug where no announcers would be loaded. [AJ]
* Restored the UserPrefAutoSetStyle behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoaderSMA] Better way of identifying beats and seconds. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1a | 20110603
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/06/03
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added LivesLeft param to LifeChanged message. [AJ]
* [Windows] Set up directories for pictures and app data in their proper
  location. [Henke]
* [NotesLoaderSM] Fix an Offset load bug. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/02
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromSteps Lua binding. [AJ]
* [ScreenDebugOverlay] Switch the R and T keys to be Volume Down and Up
  respectively. I have to admit, it makes more sense to have volume up be
  on the right instead of the left. [Wolfman2000]
* [SongManager] Make autogen courses have "Autogen" as the Scripter. [AJ]

2011/06/01
----------
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fix Song Timing behaviors. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/31
----------
* [Player] Added the BattleRaveMirror metric. This determines if Battle and
  Rave mode will have the two players with mirrored charts or not. By default,
  this is set to true, preserving the ITG style behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1 | 20110529
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/05/27
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Added the LoopOnChartEnd metric. Once you get to the end of
  the chart while playing it in the editor, this controls whether it loops and
  plays again, or simply stops. By default, this is true, replicating current
  behavior. Set to false to replicate older StepMania behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/26
----------
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] Added the MissComboIsPerRow metric. Similar to the
  ComboIsPerRow metric, this determines how much miss combo is earned on missing
  a row of notes. By default, this is true. Set to false to replicate Pump Pro
  behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/25
----------
* [NotesLoaderSSC/NotesWriterSSC] Added the ScrollSegments. Think BPM change,
  but not. [theDtTvB]

2011/05/23
----------
* [Steps] Added the UsesSplitTiming Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/20
----------
* [CryptManager] Added SHA1File Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/19
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Add CourseCycleSpeed metric. [AJ]

2011/05/17
----------
* [NotesWriterSM] Write out OpenITG compatible SM files from here on out.
  This includes turning Warps into Negative Stops. For those that wanted
  negative BPMs specifically, my apologies, but stops are easier on math.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/16
----------
* [ProfileManager] Added ProfileWasLoadedFromMemoryCard(PlayerNumber)
  Lua binding. [AJ]
* Added #FAKES to the SSC format. Similar to the fake arrows, these blocks
  prevent all judgments within the range. [Wolfman2000]
* Changed the syntax of #WARPS slightly. Now the second value is the relative
  distance that is skipped, not the absolute value when you start hitting
  arrows again. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/15
----------
* [ScreenGameplay] Removed hardcoded commands for Debug (give up text) and
  replace them with DebugStartOnCommand, DebugBackOnCommand, and
  DebugTweenOffCommand. [AJ]
* Added #SPEEDS to the SSC format. This multiplies your scrolling speed during
  gameplay, not replaces it (see mod attacks for replacing). [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/14
----------
* [ModIcon] Added StopWords metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenSelectMaster] Add "ScreenEmpty" param to MenuStartP# when the GameCommand
  doesn't set a screen. [AJ]
* [StepsDisplay] Added MeterFormatString metric. [AJ]
* [MusicWheel] Added ShowSectionsInBPMSort and ShowSectionsInLengthSort metrics. [AJ]
* [ScreenEvaluation] Stop the Bonus bars from overflowing in course modes. [AJ]
* [Banner] Added ScrollMode and ScrollSortOrder metrics. [AJ]

2011/05/13
----------
* Added Split Timing to .SSC files. All older .SSC files and other file
  formats are converted to split timing on cache load. We are no longer bound
  by Song Timing for everything. [theDtTvB, Wolfman2000, TeruFSX]

2011/05/11
----------
* [GameSoundManager] Added PlayAnnouncer Lua binding. [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Add support for "gameplay combo #" for announcer. [AJ]

2011/05/10
----------
* [Sprite] Added SetSecondsIntoAnimation Lua binding. [AJ]
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromCourse Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/03
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow changing the Beat 0 Offset, Music Sample Start, and
  Music Sample Length via Edit Song Info menu. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/02
----------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Added NullScoreString metric. [AJ]

2011/04/17
--------
* Use lua for all primary score keeping. Course modes right now still use the
  old fashioned system. [TeruFSX, Wolfman2000]

2011/04/09
--------
* [Player] Force hold judgments to take place before setting the score.
  [theDtTvB]

2011/04/05
--------
* [NotesLoaderSSC, NotesWriterSSC] Add the #LABELS tag. This is meant for step
  editors to label different parts of their stepcharts. Use Control + , or . to
  jump to different labels made. [Wolfman2000]
