[How to Install Songs]
Songs are laid out based on the group that they are in.

Songs\						: root folder
	Etterna\				: group folder
		Sandstorm\			: song/simfile folder
			*.png, *.mp3/*.ogg, *.sm/*.ssc/etc files

[How NOT to install songs]
This won't work because Etterna expects groups:

Songs\
	Some Song\
		*.png, *.mp3/*.ogg, *.sm/*.ssc/etc files

And this won't work because Etterna doesn't handle sub-groups:

Songs\
	Song Group\
		SubGroup1\
			Some Song\
				*.png, *.mp3/*.ogg, *.sm/*.ssc/etc files
             
[Where to install songs]
http://www.etternaonline.com/pack has most of the song packs that people play, although as of version 0.60.0 we now have in-game song downloading.
